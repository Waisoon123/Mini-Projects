New law will require owners of critical services to report wider range of cybersecurity incidents - CNA,"cybersecurity,Singapore Parliament","SINGAPORE: A Bill aimed at bolstering Singapore’s cybersecurity defences while accounting for changes in technology was passed by parliament on Tuesday (May 7). Under amendments to the Cybersecurity Act, owners of critical information infrastructure (CII) must now report more types of incidents including those that happen in their supply chains. This is to address the “inventiveness” of malicious cyber actors, said Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary. “As the tactics and techniques of malicious actors evolve to target systems at the periphery or along supply chains, we must also start placing our alarms at those places,” he added. The new law will allow authorities to regulate a new type of system called Systems of Temporary Cybersecurity Concern (STCC). These are systems that, for a time-limited period, are at high risk of cyberattacks, and if compromised, would damage Singapore’s national interests. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) will now also be able to manage entities beyond its current regulatory regime. These include Entities of Special Cybersecurity Interest (ESCIs). Attacks on ESCIs could have a “significant detrimental effect” on Singapore’s defence, foreign relations, economy, public health, public safety, or public order, because of the disruption of the function they perform, or the disclosure of sensitive information their computer systems contain, explained Dr Janil. The specific list of entities designated as ESCIs should not be disclosed publicly to avoid inadvertently advertising these entities as “worthy targets” to malicious actors, he added. CSA will now also be able to deal with situations where a CII is supporting an essential service from overseas. With the new changes, CSA can designate and regulate such CIIs so long as its owner is in Singapore and the computer system would have been designated as a CII had it been located in Singapore. Tabling the Bill for a second reading, Dr Janil said that it aims to tackle “shifts in the operating context” in cybersecurity, and strengthen the administration of the Act to address “operational challenges” CSA has faced. “The Cybersecurity Act has now been in force for six years. The core objectives continue to be relevant today. We’ve reviewed the Act, learning from our experiences, and taking into account changes in technology,” he explained. “In order to continue to ensure Singapore’s cybersecurity, a review and an update to the Act is needed as several aspects of our operating context have changed.”",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cybersecurity-critical-services-csa-mci-parliament-4318321,"a bill aimed at bolstering Singapore's cybersecurity defences was passed by parliament on may 7. owners of critical information infrastructure (CII) must now report more types of incidents including those that happen in their supply chains. this is to address the ""inventiveness"" of malicious cyber actors, said senior minister of state for communications and information Janil Puthucheary."
Law firm Shook Lin & Bok hit by ransomware attack - CNA,"ransomware,cybersecurity","SINGAPORE: Law firm Shook Lin & Bok was hit by a ransomware attack in April, it confirmed on Thursday (May 2). The incident was discovered on Apr 9 and the law firm said it immediately engaged a cyber security team. Its systems were contained as of 2am on Apr 10, it said in a statement to CNA. There is no evidence so far that the firm’s core document management systems, which contain client data, were affected, the statement read. The firm continues to operate as per usual. It is also working closely with cyber security teams and other specialists to minimise the impact to its clients and stakeholders arising from the “illegal cyber intrusion”. According to an article on SuspectFile, which calls itself an independent website focusing on the ransomware phenomenon, Shook Lin & Bok paid a ransom of US$1.4 million in Bitcoin to the Akira ransomware group. The group initially demanded a ransom of US$2 million, which was negotiated down after a week, the article said. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) said it was aware of the incident and has offered assistance to the law firm. “The government strongly discourages victims from paying ransom, as there is no guarantee that locked data will be decrypted or that stolen data will not be used for malicious purposes once ransom has been paid,” its spokesperson said in a statement to CNA. “Threat actors may also see such organisations as soft targets who are willing to pay up, and strike again. Paying also encourages the threat actors to continue their criminal activities and target more victims.” Shook Lin & Bok did not respond to questions about whether it paid the ransom and how much it paid. CNA understands the firm has made a police report. “All steps taken thus far in response to the illegal cyber intrusion and steps that we intend to take in future are and will be done with the best interest of our clients and stakeholders at the forefront of our consideration,” it said in its statement.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/shook-lin-and-bok-akira-ransomware-paid-ransom-bitcoin-4308441,"the incident was discovered on Apr 9 and the law firm immediately engaged a cyber security team. there is no evidence so far that the firm’s core document management systems, which contain client data, were affected, the statement read."
Getting multiple prompts to reset your Apple ID password? It’s a scam - CNA,"Apple,CSA,cybersecurity","SINGAPORE: Have you been bombarded with prompts to reset your Apple ID password? You might be the target of hackers trying to get your personal details. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) on Tuesday (Apr 9) warned iPhone users that they should press ""don't allow"" if they are prompted to reset their passwords. There have been reports of such phishing attempts in recent days. “ Cybercriminals are using this method to phish for your confidential information and take over your account. Keep your device software updated for essential security patches ,” it wrote on Facebook. It also warned that hackers are posing as Apple’s support team to request one-time password (OTP) reset codes. Apple users are urged to reject these calls. “Never share your OTP or login information with anyone over messages or calls,” said CSA. In an advisory in March, Apple said scammers can trick users into sharing information through fraudulent emails and other messages that look like they're from legitimate companies, including Apple. Misleading pop-ups and ads that say the device has a security problem, and scam phone calls or voicemails that impersonate Apple Support can also be methods through which hackers use to target people. Users can protect their Apple ID by enabling two-factor authentication and never sharing their password or verification codes with others. ""If you receive a suspicious email or SMS text message that looks like it's supposed to be from Apple, please email it to reportphishing [at] apple.com ,"" the advisory wrote.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/apple-id-password-prompts-phishing-scam-csa-4252956,"the cyber security agency of Singapore warns users to press ""don't allow"" if they are prompted to reset their passwords. there have been reports of such phishing attempts in recent days, according to the CSA. users can protect their Apple ID by enabling two-factor authentication and never sharing password or verification codes with others.

"Proposed law will require owners of critical services like water, banking to report more types of cybersecurity incidents - CNA","cybersecurity,CSA,Singapore Parliament","SINGAPORE: Owners of critical information infrastructure (CII), such as those providing water, electricity and banking services, will be required to report more types of cybersecurity incidents, including those that happen in their supply chains, under a new proposed law. This way, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) said it can be more aware of the cybersecurity threats that could potentially cause disruptions to Singapore’s essential services and work with owners more proactively to secure them. Tabled in parliament on Wednesday (Apr 3), the Cybersecurity (Amendment) Bill will update existing provisions relating to the cybersecurity of CII as well as expand CSA’s oversight to cover Systems of Temporary Cybersecurity Concern or STCCs. This refers to computer systems that are critical to Singapore and are at a high risk of cyberattacks because of certain events or situations. The Bill seeks to amend the Cybersecurity Act 2018, which establishes a legal framework for the oversight and maintenance of national cybersecurity in Singapore. The objective of the Bill, which would amend the Act for the first time, is to ensure that the law keeps pace with developments in the cyber threat landscape, as well as Singapore’s evolving technological operations, said CSA in a media release on Wednesday. A key aspect of the Bill is also to ensure that CII owners remain responsible for the cybersecurity and cyber resilience of the systems, while embracing new technological and business models such as cloud computing, said CSA. The intention to amend the law was first laid out by Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo last month when she spoke in parliament about her ministry’s spending plan.

"Spying in Singapore? Inevitable given hosting of high-level events amid geopolitical tensions, say experts - CNA","spies,espionage,cybersecurity","SINGAPORE: When Russian media leaked a recording of a German military phone call earlier in March, Berlin said it was due to a participant dialling in through an ""unauthorised connection"" from a Singapore hotel. The participant was here to attend the Singapore Airshow . The February event would have been a ""field day"" for Russian intelligence, and hotels where attendees were staying would have been targeted by ""widespread wiretapping efforts"", German defence minister Boris Pistorius said. Singapore ""inevitably"" attracts intelligence operations given high-level events hosted in the country amid geopolitical tensions, according to international security experts. But�Singapore's hub reputation is unlikely to take a hit, they said. Event organisers and hotels, meanwhile, confirmed to CNA that they provide security support ranging from coordinating with telcos to conducting sweeps for surveillance devices. ""Cyberespionage is happening all over the world because we are more connected than ever before,"" said Dr Alan Chong, senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS). ""In terms of the geopolitical location of Singapore, to me it's no surprise. Since the Cold War, long before the digital age, we were already a base of operations by both the Communist powers and the Western powers."" Intelligence operations around the world will happen more frequently as cyberespionage makes remote spy activity possible even without an agent on site, said Dr Chong. Mr Stephane Duguin, CEO of CyberPeace Institute, said high-profile events taking place amid political tensions carry risks. ""Singapore is one of the leading hubs when it comes to cyber,"" he said. ""It is therefore not a surprise that this alters the risk profile."" Mr Benjamin Ang, RSIS senior fellow and head of the RSIS' Centre of Excellence for National Security, echoed this. ""Spying is as old as history, but current geopolitical tensions make it especially useful for governments to leak sensitive information that they have uncovered,"" he added. Dr Shashi Jayakumar, executive director of SJK Geostrategic Advisory, agreed that events in Singapore attended by prominent officials would be ""tempting"" targets for intelligence services to try and surveil for high-value information. In the case of the leaked German call, it discussed support for Ukraine against Russia's invasion, including the possible delivery of long-range Taurus cruise missiles to Kyiv.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/spy-espionage-intelligence-ops-leaked-german-call-airshow-4223826,"Singapore's hub reputation unlikely to take a hit, according to security experts. event organisers and hotels confirm they provide security support for events in the country.

Speaking in parliament on Friday (Mar 1), Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo said a potential Digital Infrastructure Act (DIA) will focus on areas that can cause a “significant impact” on the economy and society if disrupted. These include data centres and cloud providers that support the delivery of many widely used services such as banking and payments, ride-hailing, digital identities and social media, said MCI. The law could require operators to meet higher security and resilience standards to reduce the likelihood of systemic disruptions, said Mrs Teo in a speech where she Iaid out her ministry's spending plans for the year.

"Amid cybersecurity concerns, Malaysia launches central database aimed at refining targeted subsidy handouts - CNA","Malaysia,data,cybersecurity,subsidies","SINGAPORE: As part of a move towards refining its targeted subsidy approach, Malaysia has launched a Central Database Hub (PADU) that houses comprehensive information on its citizens and permanent residents which can be accessed by all government agencies, amid data security concerns. Launched on Tuesday (Jan 2), Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said that PADU will ensure that only those who are in need of government subsidies will obtain them. “(The system will) guarantee that benefits … will be enjoyed by those who are entitled to receive them. And of course, … (this will) reduce costs (and) … (financial) leakages,” he said. “Without PADU (and) effective implementation, there will be too many (financial) leakages and fraud.” As an example, Mr Anwar noted that the Malaysian government could save more than RM4 billion (US$870 million) by excluding foreigners and the rich from being granted electricity subsidies through the use of PADU. During his Budget speech in Parliament in October last year, Mr Anwar said that his administration will begin a targeted approach in the disbursement of subsidies from 2024 onwards. The move was made as a way to tackle Malaysia’s broad-based subsidies - in areas like fuel - that have negatively impacted government coffers. According to local media, Economy Ministry secretary-general Nor Azmie Diron said during the launch of PADU that the system will act as a centralised reference housing comprehensive details on individuals, including demographic data and specifics on education, health, household income, and whether a person has received social assistance. Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli stressed during his speech on Tuesday that “PADU will allow for more accurate data analytics as all government agencies will be aware of any change in the data of each citizen and household”. The information on the integrated database - which Mr Rafizi encouraged all citizens to review and update - “will improve the mechanism for determining target groups, streamlining delivery channels and enabling more effective program implementation”. Members of the public have until March 31 later this year to update their information on the database. “God willing, PADU will help the government to provide a more accurate measurement of the socioeconomic position of the people and avoid misidentification based on (a person’s) net disposable income,” he said during his speech on Tuesday. Noting cybersecurity concerns, Mr Rafizi said that measures have been adopted to protect the data in PADU. “When the government has data of this size, the risk in terms of data intrusion and data security is a (significant concern) … The development of PADU (has taken) into account all aspects related to system security risks and classified information breaches,” he said. He added that measures adopted include establishing comprehensive standard operating procedures (SOPs) as well as strategic cooperation between groups - namely the National Cyber Security Agency (NACSA), the Office of the Chief Government Security Officer (CGSO), CyberSecurity Malaysia and the Department of Personal Data Protection (PDP). “The government has also appointed a group of independent experts with expertise in various fields who act as a check and balance in ensuring that PADU’s development includes the latest and best safety features,” said Mr Rafizi. Last year, Malaysia saw a series of data breach attempts on some of its government agencies. On Dec 8, 2023, Malaysia’s social security organisation (SOCSO) confirmed a cyber attack on its systems, database and websites since Dec 2 that year. According to the Malay Mail, the organisation said that it had also experienced an attempted data breach in September. And according to a CyberSecurity Malaysia report, the government sector saw the highest number of data breaches in the first half of 2023, making up 22 per cent of all data breaches in the country.",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-padu-database-information-cybersecurity-government-subsidies-4020801,"Malaysia has launched a central database hub (PADU) that houses comprehensive information on its citizens and permanent residents. it will ensure that only those who are in need of government subsidies will obtain them - and will reduce costs and financial leakages, he said. the government could save more than RM4 billion (US$870 million) by excluding foreigners and the rich from being granted electricity subsidies through the use of PADU."

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-4323, has been codenamed Linguistic Lumberjack by Tenable Research. It impacts versions from 2.0.7 through 3.0.3, with fixes available in version 3.0.4. The issue relates to a case of memory corruption in Fluent Bit's built-in HTTP server that could allow for DoS, information leakage, or remote code execution. Specifically, it relates to sending maliciously crafted requests to the monitoring API through endpoints such as /api/v1/traces and /api/v1/trace. ""Regardless of whether or not any traces are configured, it is still possible for any user with access to this API endpoint to query it,"" security researcher Jimi Sebree said. ""During the parsing of incoming requests for the /api/v1/traces endpoint, the data types of input names are not properly validated before being parsed."" By default, the data types are assumed to be strings (i.e., MSGPACK_OBJECT_STR), which a threat actor could exploit by passing non-string values, leading to memory corruption. Tenable said it was able to reliably exploit the issue to crash the service and cause a DoS condition. Remote code execution, on the other hand, is dependent on a variety of environmental factors such as host architecture and operating system. Users are recommended to update to the latest version to mitigate potential security threats, especially given that a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit has been made available for the flaw.",https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/linguistic-lumberjack-vulnerability.html,"cybersecurity researchers have discovered a critical security flaw in Fluent Bit. it could be exploited to achieve denial-of-service (DoS), information disclosure, or remote code execution. the issue affects versions from 2.0.7 through 3.0.3, with fixes available in version 3.0.4."

Of the 61 flaws, one is rated Critical, 59 are rated Important, and one is rated Moderate in severity. This is in addition to 30 vulnerabilities resolved in the Chromium-based Edge browser over the past month, including two recently disclosed zero-days (CVE-2024-4671 and CVE-2024-4761) that have been tagged as exploited in attacks. The two security shortcomings that have been weaponized in the wild are below - ""An unauthenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain code execution through convincing a user to open a malicious document at which point the attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the user,"" the tech giant said in an advisory for CVE-2024-30040. However, successful exploitation requires an attacker to convince the user to load a specially crafted file onto a vulnerable system, distributed either via email or an instant message, and trick them into manipulating it. Interestingly, the victim doesn't have to click or open the malicious file to activate the infection. On the other hand, CVE-2024-30051 could allow a threat actor to gain SYSTEM privileges. Three groups of researchers from Kaspersky, DBAPPSecurity WeBin Lab, Google Threat Analysis Group, and Mandiant have been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw, indicating likely widespread exploitation. ""We have seen it used together with QakBot and other malware, and believe that multiple threat actors have access to it,"" Kaspersky researchers Boris Larin and Mert Degirmenci said. Both vulnerabilities have been added by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the latest fixes by June 4, 2024. Also resolved by Microsoft are several remote code execution bugs, including nine impacting Windows Mobile Broadband Driver and seven affecting Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS). Other notable flaws encompass privilege escalation flaws in the Common Log File System (CLFS) driver – CVE-2024-29996, CVE-2024-30025 (CVSS scores: 7.8), and CVE-2024-30037 (CVSS score: 7.5) – Win32k (CVE-2024-30028 and CVE-2024-30030, CVSS scores: 7.8), Windows Search Service (CVE-2024-30033, CVSS score: 7.0), and Windows Kernel (CVE-2024-30018, CVSS score: 7.8). In March 2024, Kaspersky revealed that threat actors are attempting to actively exploit now-patched privilege escalation flaws in various Windows components owing to the fact that ""it's a very easy way to get a quick NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM."" Akamai has further outlined a new privilege escalation technique affecting Active Directory (AD) environments that takes advantage of the DHCP administrators group. ""In cases where the DHCP server role is installed on a Domain Controller (DC), this could enable them to gain domain admin privileges,"" the company noted. ""In addition to providing a privilege escalation primitive, the same technique could also be used to create a stealthy domain persistence mechanism."" Rounding off the list is a security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-30050, CVSS score: 5.4) impacting Windows Mark-of-the-Web (MotW) that could be exploited by means of a malicious file to evade defenses. Microsoft, which was recently castigated for a series of security lapses that led to a breach of its infrastructure by nation-state actors from China and Russia, has laid out a series of steps to prioritize security above all other product features as part of its Secure Future Initiative (SFI). ""In addition, we will instill accountability by basing part of the compensation of the company’s Senior Leadership Team on our progress in meeting our security plans and milestones,"" Charlie Bell, executive vice president of Microsoft Security, said. In addition to Microsoft, security updates have also been released by other vendors over the past few weeks to rectify several vulnerabilities, including —",https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/microsoft-patches-61-flaws-including.html,"two zero-day vulnerabilities have been actively exploited in the wild. one is rated critical, 59 are important, and a third is Moderate in severity, according to the tech giant's patch Tuesday update for may 2024. meanwhile, 30 other security flaws have also been resolved in its Chromium-based Edge browser over the past month, including two recently disclosed zero days (CVE-2024-4761)"
What's the Right EDR for You?,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","Cybersecurity has become an ongoing battle between hackers and small- and mid-sized businesses. Though perimeter security measures like antivirus and firewalls have traditionally served as the frontlines of defense, the battleground has shifted to endpoints. This is why endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions now serve as critical weapons in the fight, empowering you and your organization to detect known and unknown threats, respond to them quickly, and extend the cybersecurity fight across all phases of an attack.  With the growing need to defend your devices from today's cyber threats, however, choosing the right EDR solution can be a daunting task. There are so many options and features to choose from, and not all EDR solutions are made with everyday businesses and IT teams in mind. So how do you pick the best solution for your needs? Because of its ability to monitor for and alert you to malicious activity, EDR solutions can be one of the most powerful tools in your cybersecurity arsenal. EDR is an endpoint security solution designed to detect even the most subtle cyber threats and allow teams to respond to them more quickly. It provides unparalleled visibility and detection capabilities across endpoints, which means it can often catch threats that perimeter security measures—like antivirus and firewalls—might miss. Typically, EDR solutions should have the ability to track and analyze endpoint activity and enable analysts to respond when suspicious activity is detected. Along with this functionality, a modern and effective EDR solution can bring many advantages, including: Simply put, EDR solutions capture the relevant events occurring on every endpoint it's installed on. Every login. Every running process. Every bootup and shutdown. It's all monitored and logged to provide a full picture of what's happening at the endpoint level.  That granularity also helps create a baseline of expected endpoint activity. And from that baseline, security analysts or machine learning algorithms can help determine what's ""normal"" behavior for your organization and what appears to be ""abnormal.""  For example, if one of your employees opens a phishing email and downloads an attached document, and that document runs a malicious program, EDR will step in to flag that behavior and automatically generate an alert to let your team know that something's wrong.  EDR solutions heavily rely on data collection, which gives analysts a lot of helpful context like who, what, where, when, and how an attack may have occurred. Depending on configuration, some EDR solutions have the ability to isolate host machines when malicious activity is detected to prevent lateral movement throughout the network.  That's really what sets EDR apart from antivirus solutions and why it's a complementary layer in any security stack. EDR technology can analyze billions of events in real time—including comparing indicators of compromise (IOCs), scanning for known threats using traditional malware signatures, and using behavioral detections for threats that might be unknown. And, of course, EDR solutions offer the critical ability of enabling threat response.  Keep in mind, however, while EDRs excel at flagging potential threat actor activity and quickly alerting it, they're not a ""set it and forget it"" kind of tool. EDR solutions require consistent tuning and close management by security analysts to investigate alerts and verify real threats from false positives.  Whether it's your first time venturing into EDRs or you're looking for a better-fitting solution, asking the right questions can point you in the right direction. Here's what you should consider as you go through your evaluation process.  It's important to note that implementing an EDR alone doesn't give your organization EDR capabilities. Cybersecurity professionals are often required to manage your EDR effectively. Without the right team and time commitment, EDR solutions can amass excessive data and alerts, leading to higher costs and overburdening analysts. If your team doesn't have at least one full-time employee dedicated to triaging, investigating, and responding to alerts, you should consider a managed EDR solution. EDR solutions can be either managed or unmanaged, and each option has its own pros and cons. Unmanaged EDR solutions offer greater control and customization, but you're typically responsible for the setup, configuration, and management of the solution. Managed EDR solutions provide all of the benefits of an EDR solution without the need to manage it all in-house—that's typically handled by a third-party vendor. These solutions often provide you with a team of experts who can help with day-to-day management, investigations, and alerts. The right choice will depend on your specific needs and resources. If you have the internal resources to maintain an EDR solution yourself, an unmanaged solution could be the right fit for you. But if you can't support the added time, skill, or headcount, a managed EDR solution is your ideal option. When you're evaluating EDR solutions, there are a few must-have criteria to consider.  EDR solutions must be able to collect crucial information across endpoints and provide a clear picture of what's happening at any given point in time. This includes continuously monitoring relevant activity on endpoint devices, application-level events, and processes that are running. A good EDR solution should provide visibility into the entire lifecycle of an attack, from initial compromise to exfiltration of data.  An EDR solution should be able to pick up on threat activity and present the right data at the right time, allowing security teams to quickly respond to threats and minimize their potential impact. This includes the ability to identify anomalies and suspicious activity, as well as detect known threats using signature-based detection.  Timely response and mitigation are an integral part of any EDR solution. Your solution should be able to identify and classify threats accurately. It should also provide actionable intelligence and offer an easy way to mitigate a threat once it's uncovered. In some cases, this includes the ability to kill processes, quarantine files, remove persistence mechanisms, or isolate endpoints. Your EDR should seamlessly integrate with your existing security tools without requiring extensive configuration. Compatibility is crucial to ensure minimal impact on endpoint performance, so choose a solution that plays nice with your other tools and has little to no impact on your endpoint users.  An ideal EDR solution should be easy to roll out and use, with a user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation. It should also be easy to deploy across numerous endpoints in a scalable and cost-effective way.  Some EDR solutions are made for enterprise-sized wallets, so don't be afraid to shop around and select one that fits your budget. Just because something is expensive doesn't make it better, and conversely, something less expensive doesn't necessarily mean it's lower quality. A good EDR solution will allow you to create your own custom searches and rules to help tune out the noise. If you have an EDR solution that isn't collecting valuable analytics or tuning detections, you're setting yourself up for failure and most likely missing malicious activity. The best EDR solutions should proactively hunt for threats beyond the solution's detection capabilities. That could mean the solution offers a large library of prebuilt detections, or it's backed by a dedicated team of experts who can track down potentially malicious activity on your behalf.  Because EDR solutions require a lot of time and attention, more businesses are opting for a fully managed solution. With managed EDR solutions, you get all EDR functionalities without the headaches and growing pains. Managed EDR solutions typically include access to a team of security experts who can help reduce alert fatigue and false positives, and can offer enhanced visibility and threat hunting capabilities.  To address the staffing, expertise, and resource challenges that come with many of today's EDR solutions, businesses and IT teams are turning to managed EDR solutions instead of the traditional self-managed approach.  A managed EDR solution is typically provided as a service, with a vendor managing the EDR infrastructure and providing ongoing monitoring, analysis, and response assistance.  One of the main benefits of a managed EDR solution is the ability to offload the burden of managing the solution to a team of security experts. Hackers don't just work 9 to 5, and that's why managed EDR solutions are often backed by a security team who can provide 24/7 coverage—not to mention help with day-to-day management like triaging alerts, threat investigations, and incident response. Plus, they have the technical know-how to investigate suspicious activity, offer mitigation guidance, and deal with threats in real time, giving you direct access to their expertise without needing to find and retain that talent in-house.  A managed EDR solution typically includes advanced analytics capabilities or an element of verification from a team of analysts, which can help filter out false positives and prioritize the most critical alerts before they even cross your desk. This can help security teams more effectively identify and respond to threats, rather than overwhelming them with the irrelevant noise that can come with self-managed solutions. Overall, a managed EDR solution can provide non-enterprise businesses with an effective and efficient way to detect and respond to threats, while also addressing common challenges and pitfalls associated with unmanaged EDR solutions. Huntress Managed EDR is a purpose-built solution backed by a 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC).

Malicious Python Package Hides Sliver C2 Framework in Fake Requests Library Logo,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","Cybersecurity researchers have identified a malicious Python package that purports to be an offshoot of the popular requests library and has been found concealing a Golang-version of the Sliver command-and-control (C2) framework within a PNG image of the project's logo.  The package employing this steganographic trickery is requests-darwin-lite, which has been downloaded 417 times prior to it being taken down from the Python Package Index (PyPI) registry. Requests-darwin-lite ""appeared to be a fork of the ever-popular requests package with a few key differences, most notably the inclusion of a malicious Go binary packed into a large version of the actual requests side-bar PNG logo,"" software supply chain security firm Phylum said. The changes have been introduced in the package's setup.py file, which has been configured to decode and execute a Base64-encoded command to gather the system's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), but only after confirming that the compromised host is running Apple macOS. The finding also comes a little over a month after the company discovered a rogue npm package named vue2util that poses as a helper utility but is designed to carry out a cryptojacking scheme and steal a victim's USDT tokens. The package ""exploits the ERC20 contract (USDT) approval mechanism, covertly granting unlimited approval to the attacker’s contract address, effectively allowing the attacker to drain the victim’s USDT tokens,"" Phylum noted. In what's an interesting twist, the infection chain proceeds only if the identifier matches a particular value, implying that the author(s) behind the package is looking to breach a specific machine to which they are already in possession of the identifier obtained through some other means. This raises two possibilities: Either it's a highly targeted attack or it's some sort of a testing process ahead of a broader campaign. Should the UUID match, the requests-darwin-lite proceeds to read data from a PNG file named ""requests-sidebar-large.png,"" which bears similarities with the legitimate requests package that ships with a similar file called ""requests-sidebar.png.""  What's different here is that while the real logo embedded within requests has a file size of 300 kB, the one contained inside requests-darwin-lite is around 17 MB. The binary data concealed in the PNG image is the Golang-based Sliver, an open-source C2 framework that's designed to be used by security professionals in their red team operations. The exact end goal of the package is currently unclear, but the development is once again a sign that open-source ecosystems continue to be an attractive vector to distribute malware. With a vast majority of codebases relying on open-source code, the steady influx of malware into npm, PyPI, and other package registries, not to mention the recent XZ Utils episode, has highlighted the need for addressing issues in a systematic manner that otherwise can ""derail large swaths of the web.""

Kremlin-Backed APT28 Targets Polish Institutions in Large-Scale Malware Campaign,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","Polish government institutions have been targeted as part of a large-scale malware campaign orchestrated by a Russia-linked nation-state actor called APT28. ""The campaign sent emails with content intended to arouse the recipient's interest and persuade him to click on the link,"" the computer emergency response team, CERT Polska, said in a Wednesday bulletin. Clicking on the link redirects the victim to the domain run.mocky[.]io, which, in turn, is used to redirect to another legitimate site named webhook[.]site, a free service that allows developers to inspect data that's being sent via a webhook, in an effort to evade detection. The next step involves the download of a ZIP archive file from webhook[.]site, which contains the Windows Calculator binary that masquerades as a JPG image file (""IMG-238279780.jpg.exe""), a hidden batch script file, and another hidden DLL file (""WindowsCodecs.dll""). Should a victim run the application, the malicious DLL file is side-loaded by means of a technique called DLL side-loading to ultimately run the batch script, while images of an ""actual woman in a swimsuit along with links to her real accounts on social media platforms"" are displayed in a web browser to maintain the ruse. The batch script simultaneously downloads a JPG image (""IMG-238279780.jpg"") from webhook[.]site that's subsequently renamed to a CMD script (""IMG-238279780.cmd) and executed, following which it retrieves the final-stage payload to gather information about the compromised host and send the details back. CERT Polska said the attack chain bears similarities to a previous campaign that propagated a custom backdoor called HeadLace.  It's worth noting that the abuse of legitimate services like Mocky and webhook[.]site is a tactic repeatedly adopted by APT28 actors so as to sidestep detection by security software. ""If your organization does not use the above-mentioned services, we recommend that you consider blocking the above-mentioned domains on edge devices,"" it added. ""Regardless of whether you use the above-mentioned websites, we also recommend filtering emails for links in webhook.site and run.mocky.io, because cases of their legitimate use in the email content are very rare."" The development comes days after NATO countries accused the Kremlin-backed group of conducting a long-term cyber espionage campaign targeting their political entities, state institutions, and critical infrastructure. APT28's malicious activities have also expanded to target iOS devices with the XAgent spyware, which was first detailed by Trend Micro in connection with a campaign dubbed Operation Pawn Storm in February 2015. ""Primarily targeting political and government entities in Western Europe, XAgent possesses capabilities for remote control and data exfiltration,"" Broadcom-owned Symantec said. ""It can gather information on users' contacts, messages, device details, installed applications, screenshots, and call records. This data could potentially be used for social engineering or spear-phishing campaigns."" News of APT28's attacks on Polish entities also follows a spike in financially motivated attacks by Russian e-crime groups like UAC-0006 targeting Ukraine in the second half of 2023, even as organizations in Russia and Belarus have been targeted by a nation-state actor known as Midge to deliver malware capable of plundering sensitive information.",https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/kremlin-backed-apt28-targets-polish.html,a large-scale malware campaign targeting polish government institutions has been orchestrated. the attack chain bears similarities to an earlier campaign that evaded detection by security software.

"Microsoft Outlook Flaw Exploited by Russia's APT28 to Hack Czech, German Entities","cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","Czechia and Germany on Friday revealed that they were the target of a long-term cyber espionage campaign conducted by the Russia-linked nation-state actor known as APT28, drawing condemnation from the European Union (E.U.), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the U.K., and the U.S. The Czech Republic's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), in a statement, said some unnamed entities in the country have been attacked using a security flaw in Microsoft Outlook that came to light early last year. ""Cyber attacks targeting political entities, state institutions and critical infrastructure are not only a threat to national security, but also disrupt the democratic processes on which our free society is based,"" the MFA said. The security flaw in question is CVE-2023-23397, a now-patched critical privilege escalation bug in Outlook that could allow an adversary to access Net-NTLMv2 hashes and then use them to authenticate themselves by means of a relay attack. Germany's Federal Government (aka Bundesregierung) attributed the threat actor to a cyber attack aimed at the Executive Committee of the Social Democratic Party using the same Outlook vulnerability for a ""relatively long period,"" allowing it to ""compromise numerous email accounts."" Some of the industry verticals targeted as part of the campaign include logistics, armaments, the air and space industry, IT services, foundations, and associations located in Germany, Ukraine, and Europe, with the Bundesregierung also implicating the group to the 2015 attack on the German federal parliament (Bundestag). APT28, assessed to be linked to Military Unit 26165 of the Russian Federation's military intelligence agency GRU, is also tracked by the broader cybersecurity community under the names BlueDelta, Fancy Bear, Forest Blizzard (formerly Strontium), FROZENLAKE, Iron Twilight, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy, and TA422. Late last month, Microsoft attributed the hacking group to the exploitation of a Microsoft Windows Print Spooler component (CVE-2022-38028, CVSS score: 7.8) as a zero-day to deliver a previously unknown custom malware called GooseEgg to infiltrate Ukrainian, Western European, and North American government, non-governmental, education, and transportation sector organizations. NATO said Russia's hybrid actions ""constitute a threat to Allied security."" The Council of the European Union also chimed in, stating the ""malicious cyber campaign shows Russia's continuous pattern of irresponsible behavior in cyberspace.""  ""Recent activity by Russian GRU cyber group APT28, including the targeting of the German Social Democratic Party executive, is the latest in a known pattern of behavior by the Russian Intelligence Services to undermine democratic processes across the globe,"" the U.K. government said. The U.S. Department of State described APT28 as known to engage in ""malicious, nefarious, destabilizing and disruptive behavior"" and that it's committed to the ""security of our allies and partners and upholding the rules-based international order, including in cyberspace."" Earlier this February, a coordinated law enforcement action disrupted a botnet comprising hundreds of small office and home office (SOHO) routers in the U.S. and Germany that the APT28 actors are believed to have used to conceal their malicious activities, which, among others, comprised the exploitation of CVE-2023-23397 against targets of interest. According to a report from cybersecurity firm Trend Micro this week, the third-party criminal proxy botnet dates back to 2016 and consists of more than just routers from Ubiquiti, encompassing other Linux-based routers, Raspberry Pi devices, and virtual private servers (VPS). ""The threat actor [behind the botnet] managed to move over some of the EdgeRouter bots from the C&C [command-and-control] server that was taken down on January 26, 2024, to a newly set up C&C infrastructure in early February 2024,"" the company said, adding legal constraints and technical challenges prevented a thorough cleanup of all ensnared routers. Russian state-sponsored cyber threat activity – data theft, destructive attacks, DDoS campaigns, and influence operations – is also expected to pose a severe risk to elections in regions like the U.S., the U.K., and the E.U. from multiple groups such as APT28, APT29, APT44 (aka Sandworm), COLDRIVER, and KillNet, per an assessment released by Google Cloud subsidiary Mandiant last week. ""In 2016, GRU-linked APT28 compromised U.S. Democratic Party organization targets as well as the personal account of the Democratic presidential candidate's campaign chairman and orchestrated a leak campaign ahead of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election,"" researchers Kelli Vanderlee and Jamie Collier said. What's more, data from Cloudflare and NETSCOUT show a surge in DDoS attacks targeting Sweden following its acceptance to the NATO alliance, mirroring the pattern observed during Finland's NATO accession in 2023. ""The likely culprits of these attacks included the hacker groups NoName057, Anonymous Sudan, Russian Cyber Army Team, and KillNet,"" NETSCOUT said. ""All these groups are politically motivated, supporting Russian ideals."" A report released by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) in December 2023 said that DDoS attacks are increasingly fueled by warfare and geopolitical motivations, stating the current DoS threat landscape is influenced to a great extent by the emergence of recent armed conflicts around the world, allowing threat actors to choose targets without any repercussions. The developments come as government agencies from Canada, the U.K., and the U.S. have released a new joint fact sheet to help secure critical infrastructure organizations from continued attacks launched by apparent pro-Russia hacktivists against industrial control systems (ICS) and small-scale operational technology (OT) systems since 2022. ""The pro-Russia hacktivist activity appears mostly limited to unsophisticated techniques that manipulate ICS equipment to create nuisance effects,"" the agencies said. ""However, investigations have identified that these actors are capable of techniques that pose physical threats against insecure and misconfigured OT environments."" Targets of these attacks comprise organizations in North American and European critical infrastructure sectors, including water and wastewater systems, dams, energy, and food and agriculture sectors. The hacktivist groups have been observed gaining remote access by exploiting publicly exposed internet-facing connections as well as factory default passwords associated with human machine interfaces (HMIs) prevalent in such environments, followed by tampering with mission-critical parameters, turning off alarm mechanisms, and locking out operators by changing administrative passwords. Recommendations to mitigate the threat include hardening human machine interfaces, limiting exposure of OT systems to the internet, using strong and unique passwords, and implementing multi-factor authentication for all access to the OT network. ""These hacktivists seek to compromise modular, internet-exposed industrial control systems (ICS) through their software components, such as human machine interfaces (HMIs), by exploiting virtual network computing (VNC) remote access software and default passwords,"" the alert said.",https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/microsoft-outlook-flaw-exploited-by.html,"a security flaw in Microsoft Outlook could allow an adversary to access Net-NTLMv2 hashes. some unnamed entities in the country have been attacked using the bug, the MFA says. the u.s. and the european union have condemned the cyber espionage group as ""politically motivated"" the group is linked to military unit 26165 of the Russian Federation's military intelligence agency."
Dropbox Discloses Breach of Digital Signature Service Affecting All Users,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","Cloud storage services provider Dropbox on Wednesday disclosed that Dropbox Sign (formerly HelloSign) was breached by unidentified threat actors, who accessed emails, usernames, and general account settings associated with all users of the digital signature product. The company, in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said it became aware of the ""unauthorized access"" on April 24, 2024. Dropbox announced its plans to acquire HelloSign in January 2019. ""The threat actor had accessed data related to all users of Dropbox Sign, such as emails and usernames, in addition to general account settings,"" it said in the Form 8-K filing.. ""For subsets of users, the threat actor also accessed phone numbers, hashed passwords, and certain authentication information such as API keys, OAuth tokens, and multi-factor authentication."" Even worse, the intrusion also affects third-parties who received or signed a document through Dropbox Sign, but never created an account themselves, specifically exposing their names and email addresses. Investigation conducted so far has uncovered no evidence that the attackers accessed the contents of users' accounts, such as agreements or templates, or their payment information. The incident is also said to be restricted to Dropbox Sign infrastructure. The attackers are believed to have gained access to a Dropbox Sign automated system configuration tool and compromised a service account that's part of Sign's backend, exploiting the account's elevated privileges to access its customer database. The company, however, did not disclose how many customers were affected by the hack, but said it's in the process of reaching out to all impacted users alongside ""step-by-step instructions"" to protect their information. ""Our security team also reset users' passwords, logged users out of any devices they had connected to Dropbox Sign, and is coordinating the rotation of all API keys and OAuth tokens,"" it said. Dropbox also said it's cooperating with law enforcement and regulatory authorities on the matter. Further analysis of the breach remains ongoing. The breach is the second such incident to target Dropbox within two years.

Android Malware Wpeeper Uses Compromised WordPress Sites to Hide C2 Servers,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a previously undocumented malware targeting Android devices that uses compromised WordPress sites as relays for its actual command-and-control (C2) servers for detection evasion. The malware, codenamed Wpeeper, is an ELF binary that leverages the HTTPS protocol to secure its C2 communications. ""Wpeeper is a typical backdoor Trojan for Android systems, supporting functions such as collecting sensitive device information, managing files and directories, uploading and downloading, and executing commands,"" researchers from the QiAnXin XLab team said. The ELF binary is embedded within a repackaged application that purports to be the UPtodown App Store app for Android (package name ""com.uptodown""), with the APK file acting as a delivery vehicle for the backdoor in a manner that evades detection. The Chinese cybersecurity firm said it discovered the malware after it detected a Wpeeper artifact with zero detection on the VirusTotal platform on April 18, 2024. The campaign is said to have come to an abrupt end four days later. The use of the Uptodown App Store app for the campaign indicates an attempt to pass off a legitimate third-party app marketplace and trick unsuspecting users into installing it. According to stats on Android-apk.org, the trojanized version of the app (5.92) has been downloaded 2,609 times to date. Wpeeper relies on a multi-tier C2 architecture that uses infected WordPress sites as an intermediary to obscure its true C2 servers. As many as 45 C2 servers have been identified as part of the infrastructure, nine of which are hard-coded into the samples and are used to update the C2 list on the fly.  ""These [hard-coded servers] are not C2s but C2 redirectors -- their role is to forward the bot's requests to the real C2, aimed at shielding the actual C2 from detection,"" the researchers said. This has also raised the possibility that some of the hard-coded servers are directly under their control, since there is a risk of losing access to the botnet should WordPress site administrators get wind of the compromise and take steps to correct it. The commands retrieved from the C2 server allow the malware to collect device and file information, list of installed apps, update the C2 server, download and execute additional payloads from the C2 server or an arbitrary URL, and self-delete itself. The exact goals and scale of the campaign are presently unknown, although it's suspected that the sneaky method may have been used to increase the installation numbers and then reveal the malware's capabilities. To mitigate the risks posed by such malware, it's always advised to install apps only from trusted sources, and scrutinize app reviews and permissions prior to downloading them. A Google spokesperson shared the below statement following the publication of the story - Based on our current detection, no apps containing this malware are found on Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.",https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/android-malware-wpeeper-uses.html,"the malware, codenamed Wpeeper, is an ELF binary that leverages the HTTPS protocol. it uses compromised WordPress sites as relays for its actual command-and-control (C2) servers for detection evasion. the exact goals and scale of the campaign are presently unknown, although it's suspected that the sneaky method may have been used to increase the installation numbers."
New U.K. Law Bans Default Passwords on Smart Devices Starting April 2024,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is calling on manufacturers of smart devices to comply with new legislation that prohibits them from using default passwords, effective April 29, 2024. ""The law, known as the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure act (or PSTI act), will help consumers to choose smart devices that have been designed to provide ongoing protection against cyber attacks,"" the NCSC said. To that end, manufacturers are required to not supply devices that use guessable default passwords, provide a point of contact to report security issues, and state the duration for which their devices are expected to receive important security updates. Default passwords can not only be easily found online, they also act as a vector for threat actors to log in to devices for follow-on exploitation. That said, a unique default password is permissible under the law. The law, which aims to enforce a set of minimum security standards across the board and prevent vulnerable devices from being corralled into a DDoS botnet like Mirai, applies to the following products that can be connected to the internet - Companies that fail to adhere to the provisions of the PSTI act are liable to face recalls and monetary penalties, attracting fines of up to �10 million ($12.5 million) or 4% of their global annual revenues, depending on whichever is higher. The development makes the U.K. the first country in the world to outlaw default usernames and passwords from IoT devices. According to Cloudflare's DDoS threat report for Q1 2024, Mirai-based attacks continue to be prevalent despite the original botnet being taken down in 2016. ""Four out of every 100 HTTP DDoS attacks, and two out of every 100 L3/4 DDoS attacks are launched by a Mirai-variant botnet,"" Omer Yoachimik and Jorge Pacheco said. ""The Mirai source code was made public, and over the years there have been many permutations of the original."" It also follows a $196 million fine issued by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) against telecom carriers AT&T ($57 million), Sprint ($12 million), T-Mobile ($80 million), and Verizon ($47 million) for illegally sharing customers' real-time location data without their consent to aggregators like LocationSmart and Zumigo, who then sold the information to third-party location-based service providers. ""No one who signed up for a cell plan thought they were giving permission for their phone company to sell a detailed record of their movements to anyone with a credit card,"" U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, who revealed the practice in 2018, said in a statement.",https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/new-uk-law-bans-default-passwords-on.html,"the product security and telecommunications infrastructure act (psti act) is effective April 29, 2024. manufacturers are required to not supply devices that use guessable default passwords, provide a point of contact to report security issues, and state the duration for which they are expected to receive important security updates. companies that fail to adhere to the provisions of the PSTI act are liable to face recalls and penalties, attracting fines of up to 10 million ($12.5"
Hackers Exploiting WP-Automatic Plugin Bug to Create Admin Accounts on WordPress Sites,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","Threat actors are attempting to actively exploit a critical security flaw in the ValvePress Automatic plugin for WordPress that could allow site takeovers. The shortcoming, tracked as CVE-2024-27956, carries a CVSS score of 9.9 out of a maximum of 10. It impacts all versions of the plugin prior to 3.92.0. The issue has been resolved in version 3.92.1 released on February 27, 2024, although the release notes make no mention of it. ""This vulnerability, a SQL injection (SQLi) flaw, poses a severe threat as attackers can exploit it to gain unauthorized access to websites, create admin‑level user accounts, upload malicious files, and potentially take full control of affected sites,"" WPScan said in an alert this week. According to the Automattic-owned company, the issue is rooted in the plugin's user authentication mechanism, which can be trivially circumvented to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database by means of specially crafted requests. In the attacks observed so far, CVE-2024-27956 is being used to unauthorized database queries and create new admin accounts on susceptible WordPress sites (e.g., names starting with ""xtw""), which could then be leveraged for follow-on post-exploitation actions. This includes installing plugins that make it possible to upload files or edit code, indicating attempts to repurpose the infected sites as stagers. ""Once a WordPress site is compromised, attackers ensure the longevity of their access by creating backdoors and obfuscating the code,"" WPScan said. ""To evade detection and maintain access, attackers may also rename the vulnerable WP‑Automatic file, making it difficult for website owners or security tools to identify or block the issue."" The file in question is ""/wp‑content/plugins/wp‑automatic/inc/csv.php,"" which is renamed to something like ""/wp‑content/plugins/wp‑automatic/inc/csv65f82ab408b3.php."" That said, it's possible that the threat actors are doing so in an attempt to prevent other attackers from exploiting the sites already under their control. CVE-2024-27956 was publicly disclosed by WordPress security firm Patchstack on March 13, 2024. Since then, more than 5.5 million attack attempts to weaponize the flaw have been detected in the wild. The disclosure comes as severe bugs have been disclosed in plugins like Email Subscribers by Icegram Express (CVE-2024-2876, CVSS score: 9.8), Forminator (CVE-2024-28890, CVSS score: 9.8), and User Registration (CVE-2024-2417, CVSS score: 8.8) that could be used to extract sensitive data like password hashes from the database, upload arbitrary files, and grant an authenticator user admin privileges. Patchstack has also warned of an unpatched issue in the Poll Maker plugin (CVE-2024-32514, CVSS score: 9.9) that allows for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server, leading to remote code execution.

State-Sponsored Hackers Exploit Two Cisco Zero-Day Vulnerabilities for Espionage,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","A new malware campaign leveraged two zero-day flaws in Cisco networking gear to deliver custom malware and facilitate covert data collection on target environments. Cisco Talos, which dubbed the activity ArcaneDoor, attributed it as the handiwork of a previously undocumented sophisticated state-sponsored actor it tracks under the name UAT4356 (aka Storm-1849 by Microsoft). ""UAT4356 deployed two backdoors as components of this campaign, 'Line Runner' and 'Line Dancer,' which were used collectively to conduct malicious actions on-target, which included configuration modification, reconnaissance, network traffic capture/exfiltration and potentially lateral movement,"" Talos said. The intrusions, which were first detected and confirmed in early January 2024, entail the exploitation of two vulnerabilities - It's worth noting that a zero-day exploit is the technique or attack a malicious actor deploys to leverage an unknown security vulnerability to gain access into a system. While the second flaw allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with root-level privileges, administrator-level privileges are required to exploit it. Addressed alongside CVE-2024-20353 and CVE-2024-20359 is a command injection flaw in the same appliance (CVE-2024-20358, CVSS score: 6.0) that was uncovered during internal security testing. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added the shortcomings to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the vendor-provided fixes by May 1, 2024. The exact initial access pathway used to breach the devices is presently unknown, although UAT4356 is said to have started preparations for it as early as July 2023.  A successful foothold is followed by the deployment of two implants named Line Dancer and Line Runner, the former of which is an in-memory backdoor that enables attackers to upload and execute arbitrary shellcode payloads, including disabling system logs and exfiltrating packet captures. Line Runner, on the other hand, is a persistent HTTP-based Lua implant installed on the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) by leveraging the aforementioned zero-days such that it can survive across reboots and upgrades. It has been observed being used to fetch information staged by Line Dancer. ""It is suspected that Line Runner may be present on a compromised device even if Line Dancer is not (e.g., as a persistent backdoor, or where an impacted ASA has not yet received full operational attention from the malicious actors),"" according to a joint advisory published by cybersecurity agencies from Australia, Canada, and the U.K. At every phase of the attack, UAT4356 is said to have demonstrated meticulous attention to hiding digital footprints and the ability to employ intricate methods to evade memory forensics and lower the chances of detection, contributing to its sophistication and elusive nature. This also suggests that the threat actors have a complete understanding of the inner workings of the ASA itself and of the ""forensic actions commonly performed by Cisco for network device integrity validation."" Exactly which country is behind ArcaneDoor is unclear, however both Chinese and Russian state-backed hackers have targeted Cisco routers for cyber espionage purposes in the past. Cisco Talos also did not specify how many customers were compromised in these attacks. The development once again highlights the increased targeting of edge devices and platforms such as email servers, firewalls, and VPNs that traditionally lack endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, as evidenced by the recent string of attacks targeting Barracuda Networks, Fortinet, Ivanti, Palo Alto Networks, and VMware. ""Perimeter network devices are the perfect intrusion point for espionage-focused campaigns,"" Talos said. ""As a critical path for data into and out of the network, these devices need to be routinely and promptly patched; using up-to-date hardware and software versions and configurations; and be closely monitored from a security perspective. Gaining a foothold on these devices allows an actor to directly pivot into an organization, reroute or modify traffic and monitor network communications.""",https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/state-sponsored-hackers-exploit-two.html,"a new malware campaign leveraged two zero-day flaws in Cisco networking gear to deliver custom malware and facilitate covert data collection on target environments. the activity, called ArcaneDoor, was attributed to an undocumented sophisticated state-sponsored actor it tracks under the name ""uat4356"" the intrusions were first detected and confirmed in early January 2024, entail the exploitation of two vulnerabilities."
ToddyCat Hacker Group Uses Advanced Tools for Industrial-Scale Data Theft,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","The threat actor known as ToddyCat has been observed using a wide range of tools to retain access to compromised environments and steal valuable data. Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky characterized the adversary as relying on various programs to harvest data on an ""industrial scale"" from primarily governmental organizations, some of them defense related, located in the Asia-Pacific region. ""To collect large volumes of data from many hosts, attackers need to automate the data harvesting process as much as possible, and provide several alternative means to continuously access and monitor systems they attack,"" security researchers Andrey Gunkin, Alexander Fedotov, and Natalya Shornikova said. ToddyCat was first documented by the company in June 2022 in connection with a series of cyber attacks aimed at government and military entities in Europe and Asia since at least December 2020. These intrusions leveraged a passive backdoor dubbed Samurai that allows for remote access to the compromised host. A closer examination of the threat actor's tradecraft has since uncovered additional data exfiltration tools like LoFiSe and Pcexter to gather data and upload archive files to Microsoft OneDrive. The latest set of programs entail a mix of tunneling data gathering software, which are put to use after the attacker has already obtained access to privileged user accounts in the infected system. This includes - Maintaining multiple simultaneous connections from the infected endpoints to actor-controlled infrastructure using different tools is seen as a fallback mechanism and a way to retain access in cases where one of the tunnels is discovered and taken down. ""The attackers are actively using techniques to bypass defenses in an attempt to mask their presence in the system,"" Kaspersky said. ""To protect the organization's infrastructure, we recommend adding to the firewall denylist the resources and IP addresses of cloud services that provide traffic tunneling. In addition, users must be required to avoid storing passwords in their browsers, as it helps attackers to access sensitive information.""",https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/russian-hacker-group-toddycat-uses.html,"the threat actor known as ToddyCat has been observed using a wide range of tools to steal valuable data. he is using various programs to harvest data on an ""industrial scale"" from primarily governmental organizations, some of them defense related, located in the Asia-Pacific region."
Russian APT Deploys New 'Kapeka' Backdoor in Eastern European Attacks,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","A previously undocumented ""flexible"" backdoor called Kapeka has been ""sporadically"" observed in cyber attacks targeting Eastern Europe, including Estonia and Ukraine, since at least mid-2022. The findings come from Finnish cybersecurity firm WithSecure, which attributed the malware to the Russia-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) group tracked as Sandworm (aka APT44 or Seashell Blizzard). Microsoft is tracking the same malware under the name KnuckleTouch. ""The malware [...] is a flexible backdoor with all the necessary functionalities to serve as an early-stage toolkit for its operators, and also to provide long-term access to the victim estate,"" security researcher Mohammad Kazem Hassan Nejad said. Kapeka comes fitted with a dropper that's designed to launch and execute a backdoor component on the infected host, after which it removes itself. The dropper is also responsible for setting up persistence for the backdoor either as a scheduled task or autorun registry, depending on whether the process has SYSTEM privileges. Microsoft, in its own advisory released in February 2024, described Kapeka as involved in multiple campaigns distributing ransomware and that it can be used to carry out a variety of functions, such as stealing credentials and other data, conducting destructive attacks, and granting threat actors remote access to the device. The backdoor is a Windows DLL written in C++ and features an embedded command-and-control (C2) configuration that's used to establish contact with an actor-controlled server and holds information about the frequency at which the server needs to be polled in order to retrieve commands. Besides masquerading as a Microsoft Word add-in to make it appear genuine, the backdoor DLL gathers information about the compromised host and implements multi-threading to fetch incoming instructions, process them, and exfiltrate the results of the execution to the C2 server.  ""The backdoor uses WinHttp 5.1 COM interface (winhttpcom.dll) to implement its network communication component,"" Nejad explained. ""The backdoor communicates with its C2 to poll for tasks and to send back fingerprinted information and task results. The backdoor utilizes JSON to send and receive information from its C2."" The implant is also capable of updating its C2 configuration on-the-fly by receiving a new version from the C2 server during polling. Some of the main features of the backdoor allow it to read and write files from and to disk, launch payloads, execute shell commands, and even upgrade and uninstall itself. The exact method through which the malware is propagated is currently unknown. However, Microsoft noted that the dropper is retrieved from compromised websites using the certutil utility, underscoring the use of a legitimate living-off-the-land binary (LOLBin) to orchestrate the attack. Kapeka's connections to Sandworm come conceptual and configuration overlaps with previously disclosed families like GreyEnergy, a likely successor to the BlackEnergy toolkit, and Prestige. ""It is likely that Kapeka was used in intrusions that led to the deployment of Prestige ransomware in late 2022,"" WithSecure said. ""It is probable that Kapeka is a successor to GreyEnergy, which itself was likely a replacement for BlackEnergy in Sandworm's arsenal."" ""The backdoor's victimology, infrequent sightings, and level of stealth and sophistication indicate APT-level activity, highly likely of Russian origin.""",https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/russian-apt-deploys-new-kapeka-backdoor.html,"a previously undocumented ""flexible"" backdoor called Kapeka has been ""sporadically"" observed in cyber attacks targeting eastern Europe. the malware is attributed to the Russia-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) group tracked as Sandworm (aka APT44 or Seashell Blizzard) Microsoft is tracking the same malware under the name KnuckleTouch."
Palo Alto Networks Releases Urgent Fixes for Exploited PAN-OS Vulnerability,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","Palo Alto Networks has released hotfixes to address a maximum-severity security flaw impacting PAN-OS software that has come under active exploitation in the wild. Tracked as CVE-2024-3400 (CVSS score: 10.0), the critical vulnerability is a case of command injection in the GlobalProtect feature that an unauthenticated attacker could weaponize to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the firewall. Fixes for the shortcoming are available in the following versions - Patches for other commonly deployed maintenance releases are expected to be released over the next few days. ""This issue is applicable only to PAN-OS 10.2, PAN-OS 11.0, and PAN-OS 11.1 firewalls configured with GlobalProtect gateway or GlobalProtect portal (or both) and device telemetry enabled,"" the company clarified in its updated advisory. It also said that while Cloud NGFW firewalls are not impacted by CVE-2024-3400, specific PAN-OS versions and distinct feature configurations of firewall VMs deployed and managed by customers in the cloud are affected. The exact origins of the threat actor exploiting the flaw are presently unknown but Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 is tracking the malicious activity under the name Operation MidnightEclipse. Volexity, which attributed it to a cluster dubbed UTA0218, said CVE-2024-3400 has been leveraged since at least March 26, 2024, to deliver a Python-based backdoor called UPSTYLE on the firewall that allows for the execution of arbitrary commands via specially crafted requests.  It is unclear how widespread the exploitation has been, but the threat intelligence firm said it has ""evidence of potential reconnaissance activity involving more widespread exploitation aimed at identifying vulnerable systems."" In attacks documented to date, UTA0218 has been observed deploying additional payloads to launch reverse shells, exfiltrate PAN-OS configuration data, remove log files, and deploy the Golang tunneling tool named GOST (GO Simple Tunnel).  No other follow-up malware or persistence methods are said to have been deployed on victim networks, although it's unknown if it's by design or due to early detection and response. Palo Alto Networks has released additional patches to remediate CVE-2024-3400 - The company has also provided a CLI command that users can run to hunt signs of potential compromise: ""grep pattern ""failed to unmarshal session(.\+.\/"" mp-log gpsvc.log*"" ""If the value between 'session(' and ')' does not look like a GUID [e.g., 01234567-89ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef], but instead contains a file system path, this indicates the need for further investigation and the log entry could be related to the successful or unsuccessful exploitation of CVE-2024-3400,"" Palo Alto Networks said. Technical details and proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code related to the flaw have been made available by WatchTowr and Rapid7, with the latter describing it as consisting of an arbitrary file creation vulnerability and a command injection bug. ""When device telemetry is enabled, a device certificate must be installed for device telemetry to successfully transmit telemetry data back to Palo Alto Networks,"" Rapid7 said. ""This transmission of data functionality is where the command injection vulnerability lies, [and] the command injection vulnerability could not be triggered without a valid device certificate installed.""",https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/palo-alto-networks-releases-urgent.html,the flaw is a case of command injection in the GlobalProtect feature. an unauthenticated attacker could weaponize to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the firewall.
