"Data of 560 million Ticketmaster customers stolen, say hackers - CNA","Australia,tickets,cybersecurity,hack","SYDNEY: A hacking group has claimed to have accessed the details of 560 million Ticketmaster customers worldwide. ShinyHunters posted evidence of the hack on the dark web, according to a screenshot shared widely on social media, claiming to have swiped the personal details of Ticketmaster customers. The group demanded a ransom payment of US$500,000, describing it as a ""one-time sale"", according to the post. The stolen data purportedly included names, addresses, emails, phone numbers and the last four digits of customer credit card numbers along with the expiry dates. CNA has contacted Ticketmaster for more information, including whether customers in Singapore were affected. Australia's government said on Thursday (May 30) that its cyber security office was ""engaging"" with United States-based Ticketmaster about the apparent hack. It urged people with ""specific inquiries"" to contact Ticketmaster directly. The FBI has offered assistance to Australian authorities after a hacking group claimed to have accessed the details of 560 million customers worldwide, a US Embassy spokesperson said on Thursday.

The FBI has offered assistance to Australian authorities after a hacking group claimed to have accessed the details of 560 million customers worldwide, a US Embassy spokesperson said on Thursday.  In January, a court in Los Angeles jailed Sebastien Raoult, a French computer hacker who was part of the ShinyHunters criminal gang. He was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay more than US$5 million in restitution after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. US prosecutors said the extensive hacking caused millions of dollars in losses to victim companies and ""unmeasurable additional losses"" to hundreds of millions of individuals whose data was sold to other criminals. Hacks are impacting more people with increasingly severe consequences, University of Wollongong cybersecurity professor Katina Michael told AFP. The number of people hacked ""will grow, it could be up to one billion in the future"", she said. Governments, companies and consumers are not doing enough to protect themselves or investing in basic protection mechanisms like two-factor authentication, Michael warned. Ticketmaster, a California-based company, operates one of the largest online ticket sales platforms in the world. The US Department of Justice last week filed a major antitrust lawsuit seeking to break up an alleged monopoly held by Live Nation Entertainment and its Ticketmaster subsidiary in the live music industry. Ticketmaster's pricing practices, with high fees and lack of alternatives, have long been a political issue in the US, with little done historically to open up the market to more competition.

Commentary: The tussle over TikTok isn’t just geopolitics - CNA,"TikTok,USA,China,data protection,cybersecurity,digital economy","SINGAPORE: Last month, US President Joe Biden signed a Bill that would ban TikTok in the United States unless its China-based owner ByteDance divests from the social media platform. This move stemmed from fears that China could compel the platform to hand over the personal data of its 170 million American users to the Chinese government under its National Intelligence Law.  In the lead-up to Biden’s sell-or-ban law, Apple removed WhatsApp and Threads from its app store in China under orders from China's cyberspace regulator citing national security concerns. Telegram and Signal, two other foreign messaging apps, were also removed for the same reason.  The ongoing technological tussle between the two major powers reflects a broader trend that is taking place all over the world. Increasingly, countries are implementing unilateral policies and initiatives to regulate the internet and digital sphere, in a bid to safeguard their autonomy and control of the internet. While the fracas between US and TikTok is unlikely to have any repercussions for Singapore, the crux of the issue - a fight over data - matters to all of us.

While the fracas between US and TikTok is unlikely to have any repercussions for Singapore, the crux of the issue - a fight over data - matters to all of us. One of the key battlegrounds for technological contestations between countries is data - who controls it, and what data belongs to whom.  Citing national security concerns and protecting citizens’ personal information, governments around the world are rolling out policies that mandate companies to store and process the data that they collect within the geographical borders of the country. This was the case for TikTok, which previously sought to assuage US lawmakers’ concerns by migrating data belonging to US users to servers owned by US-based Oracle.  Data localisation policies are also motivated by concerns that data may be transferred to countries with lax data protection laws, where our information and digital footprint risks theft and misuse.  According to a report published by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, 62 countries have implemented regulations to confine data within their borders as of 2021, nearly double that from 35 countries in 2017. In Asia, Vietnam has enacted a cybersecurity law that requires domestic companies and certain foreign firms to store personal data and other types of data locally. Cambodia is likewise drafting a law that will mandate data localisation.

Cambodia is likewise drafting a law that will mandate data localisation. Claims of national security concerns by governments should not be dismissed as an extension of increasingly fraught geopolitics. National claims to citizens’ data pose debilitating consequences for ordinary citizens like you and me. For one, data localisation policies can potentially hamper the interoperability of technical and financial services. These include cloud computing services that we use to improve collaboration and reduce cost, and telecommunications infrastructure like 5G, the backbone for modern day life. Imagine not being able to remit money home to your loved ones living abroad or a vendor who provides a service because of a country’s restrictive data regulation policy. Cross border data flows are also essential for customer service delivered round-the-clock and from distant parts of the world.  At the business level, data localisation policies can compromise the effectiveness of cybersecurity-related services that rely on cross-border data flows that include personal information. In addition, according to the Centre for Information Policy Leadership, data localisation policies can degrade other critical business functions like human resource management (particularly among multi-national companies), fraud detection and manufacturing competencies that are spread across the globe. Ironically, overly stringent data restriction policies can hamper the ability of businesses to detect cyberthreats that require personal data like IP addresses and user activity. This means that customers like you and me might be more vulnerable to malware and fraud. Thus, restrictions on cross-border data flows are potentially deleterious for Singapore’s society and economy.

The Singapore government shares the same concerns regarding national security and citizens’ data privacy. In her parliamentary speech delivered in January, Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo spoke on what the government has done to strengthen cybersecurity and ethical use of consumers’ information.  However, Singapore adopts a balanced approach to data governance, one that enables cross-border data flows while ensuring that appropriate mechanisms are in place to protect data.  For instance, it introduced the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in 2012, which established a baseline standard of protection that all organisations that collect, use or disclose personal data within Singapore must abide by.  Additionally, the PDPA only permits the transfer of personal data outside of Singapore when specific requirements are met, which ensures that the transferred data will be protected to a standard comparable to that under the PDPA. Updates were made in 2021 to strike a balance between protecting consumers' personal data and enabling businesses to harness the data for innovation. Singapore has also undertaken bilateral and multilateral initiatives to facilitate the trusted and seamless flow of data across its borders. For example, it has Digital Economy Agreements (DEAs) with five countries. These treaties support cross-border data flows while safeguarding personal information by establishing common frameworks and rules for digital trade between Singapore and the signatories.  Singapore has also joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Cross Border Privacy Rules system, which aims to bridge differing national privacy laws within the region. Such cooperation seeks to reduce barriers to cross-border flow of data.   The Singapore government shares the same concerns regarding national security and citizens’ data privacy.

To facilitate the seamless yet secure flow of data across borders, a risk-based classification framework is the practical next step. These frameworks outline specific procedures on how different tiers of data should be managed, based on their security requirements. Organisations will be able to concentrate their protection and security efforts accordingly, such that they can divert more resources to protect sensitive data while allowing the flow of less-sensitive data across borders. Additionally, Singapore should continue seeking out opportunities to enhance data interoperability with other digital economies. One promising opportunity is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA) - the first regional digital economy agreement in the world. DEFA aims to align digital trade regulations within the region and promote cross-border collaboration in nine key aspects of the digital economy, such as cybersecurity and cross-border data flows. One key challenge to address is member states’ unevenly paced legislation on data governance. With negotiations still underway, Singapore must seize this opportunity to advocate for greater convergence in member states’ data regulations. As digital sovereignty gains momentum, Singapore must remain a trailblazer in navigating an increasingly fragmented digital landscape characterised by mounting barriers to cross-border data flows. This will enable citizens and organisations to fully leverage the benefits of data flows, while safeguarding data security and privacy.

New law will require owners of critical services to report wider range of cybersecurity incidents - CNA,"cybersecurity,Singapore Parliament","SINGAPORE: A Bill aimed at bolstering Singapore’s cybersecurity defences while accounting for changes in technology was passed by parliament on Tuesday (May 7). Under amendments to the Cybersecurity Act, owners of critical information infrastructure (CII) must now report more types of incidents including those that happen in their supply chains. This is to address the “inventiveness” of malicious cyber actors, said Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary. “As the tactics and techniques of malicious actors evolve to target systems at the periphery or along supply chains, we must also start placing our alarms at those places,” he added. The new law will allow authorities to regulate a new type of system called Systems of Temporary Cybersecurity Concern (STCC). These are systems that, for a time-limited period, are at high risk of cyberattacks, and if compromised, would damage Singapore’s national interests. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) will now also be able to manage entities beyond its current regulatory regime. These include Entities of Special Cybersecurity Interest (ESCIs).  Attacks on ESCIs could have a “significant detrimental effect” on Singapore’s defence, foreign relations, economy, public health, public safety, or public order, because of the disruption of the function they perform, or the disclosure of sensitive information their computer systems contain, explained Dr Janil. The specific list of entities designated as ESCIs should not be disclosed publicly to avoid inadvertently advertising these entities as “worthy targets” to malicious actors, he added. CSA will now also be able to deal with situations where a CII is supporting an essential service from overseas. With the new changes, CSA can designate and regulate such CIIs so long as its owner is in Singapore and the computer system would have been designated as a CII had it been located in Singapore. Tabling the Bill for a second reading, Dr Janil said that it aims to tackle “shifts in the operating context” in cybersecurity, and strengthen the administration of the Act to address “operational challenges” CSA has faced.
“The Cybersecurity Act has now been in force for six years. The core objectives continue to be relevant today. We’ve reviewed the Act, learning from our experiences, and taking into account changes in technology,” he explained.

“In order to continue to ensure Singapore’s cybersecurity, a review and an update to the Act is needed as several aspects of our operating context have changed.” While Singapore implemented legislation in the form of the Cybersecurity Act in 2018, technology has evolved and business models have changed. For one, cloud computing is widely available and used. While it was once the norm for CII to be physical systems on premises and entirely owned or controlled by the CII owner, this is no longer always the case, said Dr Janil.
Now it is also possible to aggregate and share common digital services and functions across borders. This means it is needful to review how Singapore can safeguard the cybersecurity of its essential services, he added.
All this is happening amid a backdrop of increased use and reliance on digital technology.
In Singapore, over 90 per cent of residents now communicate online and firms’ technology adoption rate has grown from 74 per cent in 2018 to 94 per cent in 2022.  More are now online for longer and online for more varied purposes.  This means that there is an increased “attack surface” as people are exposed to more cyber risks, said the Senior Minister of State. The cyber threat landscape has also evolved and malicious actors are increasingly finding new ways to their target. With all this in mind, it is “vital” Singapore updates cybersecurity laws to stay ahead of the curve, said Dr Janil.

Members of Parliament supported the Bill, although they also raised questions on how CSA would cope with more reports of cybersecurity incidents and the compliance costs associated with the new obligations. Ms Tin Pei Ling (PAP-Macpherson) wanted to know if the government would consider requiring CII owners to monitor and report incidents of those further down the supply chain - beyond their immediate suppliers - in the future. Given how entities could potentially be designated as STCCs or ESCIs, Nominated Member of Parliament Mark Lee asked how businesses will be informed of or reveal and appeal designations. Some MPs called for clarity on entities that fall under ESCI, which may hold sensitive information or perform a function of national interest. Nominated Member of Parliament Razwana Begum also raised concerns about the ambiguity of the terms “sensitive information” and “function of national interest”, pointing out that a lack of clear definition could lead to inconsistencies in regulatory decisions.

Addressing concerns on increased compliance costs, Dr Janil said that neither the Cybersecurity Act nor the amendments proposed in the Bill imposes “cybersecurity obligations” on the business community at large. Instead, what the new law will do is regulate only the cybersecurity of systems infrastructure and services that are important at a national level because their disruption or compromise could affect Singapore’s survival, security, safety or other national interest, he said.  “This is a known and finite set of systems and entities. Our approach is a targeted and calibrated one, precisely because we recognise that regulation will involve compliance costs,” Dr Janil added. “Some compliance costs cannot be avoided where regulation is concerned. It's something we are mindful of. We do not seek to regulate without good reason.” Addressing concerns on increased compliance costs, Dr Janil said that neither the Cybersecurity Act nor the amendments proposed in the Bill imposes “cybersecurity obligations” on the business community at large.

CSA will then work with the owner to assess what needs to be done for the entity or system to be in compliance with the Act as well as the support and lead time that the organisation needs, said Dr Janil. Entities that receive a designation notice can also appeal against it, while ​​a regulated entity may also appeal against CSA’s decisions, orders and directions as well as codes of practice and standards of performance, he added.  Reiterating that he would not disclose any “specific real-life examples” of entities designated as ESCIs, Dr Janil said that publication and disclosure of an ESCI’s identity would be on a “case by case basis”. “The issue for consideration is not whether a regulated entity is a large company, an MNC (Multinational Corporation) or a SME (small-and-medium-size enterprises), the key consideration is whether a cyberattack on the entity could have serious implications on our national security or other national interests,” he added. “We do not take these decisions to impose obligations lightly.” On designating entities as STCCs or ESCIs, Dr Janil highlighted that CSA’s practice has been and will be to provide “ample support” to regulated entities to guide them towards compliance.  “This begins even before a system or an entity is designated,” he added.  If CSA has reason to believe that a system or entity should be designated, the agency will first engage the owner to better understand the operating context, such as the cybersecurity measures that have already been implemented and the level of their cybersecurity capabilities, to ensure that any designation is appropriate.

Getting multiple prompts to reset your Apple ID password? It’s a scam - CNA,"Apple,CSA,cybersecurity","SINGAPORE: Have you been bombarded with prompts to reset your Apple ID password? You might be the target of hackers trying to get your personal details. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) on Tuesday (Apr 9) warned iPhone users that they should press ""don't allow"" if they are prompted to reset their passwords. There have been reports of such phishing attempts in recent days. “Cybercriminals are using this method to phish for your confidential information and take over your account. Keep your device software updated for essential security patches,” it wrote on Facebook. It also warned that hackers are posing as Apple’s support team to request one-time password (OTP) reset codes. Apple users are urged to reject these calls. “Never share your OTP or login information with anyone over messages or calls,” said CSA. In an advisory in March, Apple said scammers can trick users into sharing information through fraudulent emails and other messages that look like they're from legitimate companies, including Apple. Misleading pop-ups and ads that say the device has a security problem, and scam phone calls or voicemails that impersonate Apple Support can also be methods through which hackers use to target people. Users can protect their Apple ID by enabling two-factor authentication and never sharing their password or verification codes with others.

Proposed law will require owners of critical services to report cybersecurity incidents - CNA,"cybersecurity,Cyber Security Agency of Singapore,cyber security",,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/watch/proposed-law-will-require-owners-critical-services-report-cybersecurity-incidents-4240421,
"Proposed law will require owners of critical services like water, banking to report more types of cybersecurity incidents - CNA","cybersecurity,CSA,Singapore Parliament","SINGAPORE: Owners of critical information infrastructure (CII), such as those providing water, electricity and banking services, will be required to report more types of cybersecurity incidents, including those that happen in their supply chains, under a new proposed law.  This way, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) said it can be more aware of the cybersecurity threats that could potentially cause disruptions to Singapore’s essential services and work with owners more proactively to secure them. Tabled in parliament on Wednesday (Apr 3), the Cybersecurity (Amendment) Bill will update existing provisions relating to the cybersecurity of CII as well as expand CSA’s oversight to cover Systems of Temporary Cybersecurity Concern or STCCs.  This refers to computer systems that are critical to Singapore and are at a high risk of cyberattacks because of certain events or situations. The Bill seeks to amend the Cybersecurity Act 2018, which establishes a legal framework for the oversight and maintenance of national cybersecurity in Singapore. The objective of the Bill, which would amend the Act for the first time, is to ensure that the law keeps pace with developments in the cyber threat landscape, as well as Singapore’s evolving technological operations, said CSA in a media release on Wednesday. A key aspect of the Bill is also to ensure that CII owners remain responsible for the cybersecurity and cyber resilience of the systems, while embracing new technological and business models such as cloud computing, said CSA. The intention to amend the law was first laid out by Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo last month when she spoke in parliament about her ministry’s spending plan.  She said the law needed to change to reflect the increasing importance of ensuring the cybersecurity of the digital infrastructure and services that power Singapore’s digital economy, as well as allow citizens to meet their day-to-day needs.

At present, CII owners are only required to report cybersecurity incidents concerning the critical infrastructure, and computer systems under their control that are interconnected or communicate with the infrastructure. If the new law is passed, owners will also have to report incidents targeting systems that are peripheral to CII.  Besides critical infrastructure, the Bill will also allow CSA to proactively secure STCCs to ensure the cybersecurity of these systems. An example of an STCC would be the temporary systems used to support the distribution of critical vaccines during a pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine distribution systems deployed by healthcare organisations around the world were targeted by malicious cyber actors. In addition, CSA will create two new classes of regulated entities: Entities of Special Cybersecurity Interest (ESCI) and Foundational Digital Infrastructure (FDI).  These two classes will be subjected to “light touch” regulations as they are not critical information infrastructure.  ESCI, such as autonomous universities, may hold sensitive information or perform a function of national interest, such that their disruption could cause potential adverse effects on the defence, foreign relations, economy, public health,  safety, or order of Singapore. Under the Bill, CSA will be able to designate and regulate ESCI for cybersecurity. The obligations imposed on these entities will not be at the same levels as that for CIIs, Singapore’s cybersecurity agency said.  Where disruptions to a regulated system or entity pose less serious risks to Singapore, CSA's regulatory approach is calibrated such that the obligations are ""not so onerous"" that they place an undue compliance burden on the regulated entities, while protecting public interest, the agency said. Hence, ESCI - unlike CII owners - are not required to submit audit reports or risk assessments to CSA. They will also not be required to participate in national cybersecurity exercises.  Lastly, the Bill also requires companies such as cloud service providers and data centres to be responsible for the cybersecurity of such digital infrastructure. This includes adhering to cybersecurity codes and standards of practice, as well as reporting prescribed cybersecurity incidents to CSA, which will also not be at the level of a CII, said the agency. CSA added that it had consulted extensively on the Bill, through stakeholder and public consultations. If passed, the agency said it will continue to consult closely with stakeholders to operationalise the Bill.

Noting that his reply applied to all such events and does not refer to any particular incident, Mr Heng emphasised the difference between the type of communication lines used. He said that secure measures are implemented for “conferences and meetings that are organised by Singapore that are of a sensitive nature – government meetings, military meetings – where communications are sensitive”, and they differ from the open platforms used by the general public. “Participants to international events and conferences, including those attended by military personnel and government leaders and officials do not, as a rule, expect the host country to provide secured means of communications,” said Mr Heng. “Even if a host country is to offer such means, it is questionable whether foreign participants are comfortable using it.” He said that foreign guests who need to transmit sensitive information will typically arrange their own secured means, such as encryption hardware or software, commercial secured or embassy lines, and other security measures. “This is the practice of MINDEF and SAF officials when attending meetings overseas,” added Mr Heng.

"Spying in Singapore? Inevitable given hosting of high-level events amid geopolitical tensions, say experts - CNA","spies,espionage,cybersecurity","SINGAPORE: When Russian media leaked a recording of a German military phone call earlier in March, Berlin said it was due to a participant dialling in through an ""unauthorised connection"" from a Singapore hotel. The participant was here to attend the Singapore Airshow. The February event would have been a ""field day"" for Russian intelligence, and hotels where attendees were staying would have been targeted by ""widespread wiretapping efforts"", German defence minister Boris Pistorius said. Singapore ""inevitably"" attracts intelligence operations given high-level events hosted in the country amid geopolitical tensions, according to international security experts. But Singapore's hub reputation is unlikely to take a hit, they said. Event organisers and hotels, meanwhile, confirmed to CNA that they provide security support ranging from coordinating with telcos to conducting sweeps for surveillance devices. ""Cyberespionage is happening all over the world because we are more connected than ever before,"" said Dr Alan Chong, senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS). ""In terms of the geopolitical location of Singapore, to me it's no surprise. Since the Cold War, long before the digital age, we were already a base of operations by both the Communist powers and the Western powers."" Intelligence operations around the world will happen more frequently as cyberespionage makes remote spy activity possible even without an agent on site, said Dr Chong. Mr Stephane Duguin, CEO of CyberPeace Institute, said high-profile events taking place amid political tensions carry risks. ""Singapore is one of the leading hubs when it comes to cyber,"" he said. ""It is therefore not a surprise that this alters the risk profile."" Mr Benjamin Ang, RSIS senior fellow and head of the RSIS' Centre of Excellence for National Security, echoed this. ""Spying is as old as history, but current geopolitical tensions make it especially useful for governments to leak sensitive information that they have uncovered,"" he added.

This is in the nature of how these agencies work."" Intelligence operations in Singapore pre-date the country's independence and have been carried out at high-level events to this day. In 1960, the US Central Intelligence Agency offered then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew US$3.3 million to cover up an unsuccessful intelligence operation. The US confirmed the attempted bribery after Mr Lee revealed it in 1965. During the Trump-Kim summit in June 2018, Singapore became the top cyberattack target in the world. Out of 40,000 cyberattacks during the two-day event, 88 per cent were launched from Russia and 97 per cent of these were targeted at Singapore, according to data collected by a US technology company. In that same month, a cyberattack on the SingHealth group's database stole the information of patients including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Singapore's government said the attack was ""the work of an advanced persistent threat group"" and that such groups are ""usually state-linked"". In 2022, the Shangri-La Group suffered a data breach of guests' information across eight of its hotels in Asia. This happened between May and July, and coincided with the Shangri-La Dialogue held at the eponymous Singapore hotel that June. The leaked German defence call was made over public video conferencing platform WebEx, though Berlin has defended its use in this instance as legitimate. Instead, Germany's defence minister blamed the intercepted call on ""individual user error"" and described it as a ""random hit in the scope of a broad-based approach"".   Dr Jayakumar noted similar suggestions that the call was intercepted by chance in the course of larger-scale operations. ""Although there are many theories, we do not know and will probably never know, as the Germans have been keen to draw a veil over this (save to say that their own systems have not been compromised),"" he said. ""We do not in fact know how targeted this compromise was. Russian intelligence services, like the services of all major powers, would have resources and capability to attempt to put the event under surveillance of a fairly large scale."" Singapore Airshow organiser Experia has procedures for data protection and data privacy. But those holding meetings at the Airshow's Changi Exhibition Centre venue or on its sidelines will have to make their own assessments of the security and privacy measures they need, said Experia's managing director Mr Leck Chet Lam. The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), which organises the Shangri-La Dialogue, told CNA that maintaining high-quality cybersecurity is a ""crucial"" component of the event. But a spokesperson said it was ""inappropriate"" to provide details of security arrangements. Mr Leonardo Hutabarat, head of solutions engineering for Asia Pacific and Japan at the LogRhythm security firm, said event organisers need to ensure secure networks and technology infrastructure at their venues. Wi-Fi networks should be secured by strong passwords, network encryption and firewall protection, while electronic devices should be updated with the latest security patches. He also suggested that event organisers devise ways for their security teams to quickly detect and respond to potential vulnerabilities and threats early on, before they escalate to full-scale attacks. The leaked German defence call was made over public video conferencing platform WebEx, though Berlin has defended its use in this instance as legitimate. Instead, Germany's defence minister blamed the intercepted call on ""individual user error"" and described it as a ""random hit in the scope of a broad-based approach"".   Dr Jayakumar noted similar suggestions that the call was intercepted by chance in the course of larger-scale operations. ""Although there are many theories, we do not know and will probably never know, as the Germans have been keen to draw a veil over this (save to say that their own systems have not been compromised),"" he said. ""We do not in fact know how targeted this compromise was. Russian intelligence services, like the services of all major powers, would have resources and capability to attempt to put the event under surveillance of a fairly large scale.""

The mysterious event, which took place between October 25 and 27, 2023, and impacted a single internet service provider (ISP) in the U.S., has been codenamed Pumpkin Eclipse by the Lumen Technologies Black Lotus Labs team. It specifically affected three router models issued by the ISP: ActionTec T3200, ActionTec T3260, and Sagemcom. ""The incident took place over a 72-hour period between October 25-27, rendered the infected devices permanently inoperable, and required a hardware-based replacement,"" the company said in a technical report. The blackout is significant, not least because it led to the abrupt removal of 49% of all modems from the impacted ISP's autonomous system number (ASN) during the time-frame. While the name of the ISP was not disclosed, evidence points to it being Windstream, which suffered an outage around the same time, causing users to report a ""steady red light"" being displayed by the impacted modems. Now, months later, Lumen's analysis has revealed a commodity remote access trojan (RAT) called Chalubo – a stealthy malware first documented by Sophos in October 2018 – as responsible for the sabotage, with the adversary opting for it presumably in an effort to complicate attribution efforts rather than use a custom toolkit. ""Chalubo has payloads designed for all major SOHO/IoT kernels, pre-built functionality to perform DDoS attacks, and can execute any Lua script sent to the bot,"" the company said. ""We suspect the Lua functionality was likely employed by the malicious actor to retrieve the destructive payload."" That said, the exact initial access method used to breach the routers is currently unclear, although it's theorized that it may have involved the abuse of weak credentials or exploited an exposed administrative interface. Upon gaining a successful foothold, the infection chain proceeds to drop shell scripts that pave the way for a loader ultimately designed to retrieve and launch Chalubo from an external server. The destructive Lua script module fetched by the trojan is unknown. A notable aspect of the campaign is its targeting of a single ASN, as opposed to others that have typically targeted a specific router model or common vulnerability, raising the possibility that it was deliberately targeted, although the motivations behind it are undetermined as yet. ""The event was unprecedented due to the number of units affected – no attack that we can recall has required the replacement of over 600,000 devices,"" Lumen said. ""In addition, this type of attack has only ever happened once before, with AcidRain used as a precursor to an active military invasion.""",https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/mysterious-cyber-attack-takes-down.html,"A destructive cyber attack, known as Pumpkin Eclipse, has bricked and taken offline more than 600,000 small office/home office (SOHO) routers, affecting three models issued by a single internet service provider (ISP) in the U.S. The attack, which took place between October 25 and 27, 2023, was caused by a commodity remote access trojan (RAT) called Chalubo, which was used to render the infected devices permanently inoperable and require hardware-based replacements.

Microsoft Warns of Surge in Cyber Attacks Targeting Internet-Exposed OT Devices,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","Microsoft has emphasized the need for securing internet-exposed operational technology (OT) devices following a spate of cyber attacks targeting such environments since late 2023. ""These repeated attacks against OT devices emphasize the crucial need to improve the security posture of OT devices and prevent critical systems from becoming easy targets,"" the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team said. The company noted that a cyber attack on an OT system could allow malicious actors to tamper with critical parameters used in industrial processes, either programmatically via the programmable logic controller (PLC) or using the graphical controls of the human-machine interface (HMI), resulting in malfunctions and system outages. It further said that OT systems often lack adequate security mechanisms, making them ripe for exploitation by adversaries and carry out attacks that are ""relatively easy to execute,"" a fact compounded by the additional risks introduced by directly connecting OT devices to the internet. This not only makes the devices discoverable by attackers through internet scanning tools, but also be weaponized to gain initial access by taking advantage of weak sign-in passwords or outdated software with known vulnerabilities. Just last week, Rockwell Automation issued an advisory urging its customers to disconnect all industrial control systems (ICSs) not meant to be connected to the public-facing internet due to ""heightened geopolitical tensions and adversarial cyber activity globally."" The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has also released a bulletin of its own warning of pro-Russia hacktivists targeting vulnerable industrial control systems in North America and Europe. ""Specifically, pro-Russia hacktivists manipulated HMIs, causing water pumps and blower equipment to exceed their normal operating parameters,"" the agency said. ""In each case, the hacktivists maxed out set points, altered other settings, turned off alarm mechanisms, and changed administrative passwords to lock out the WWS operators."" Microsoft further said the onset of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023 led to a spike in cyber attacks against internet-exposed, poorly secured OT assets developed by Israeli companies, with many of them conducted by groups like Cyber Av3ngers, Soldiers of Solomon, and Abnaa Al-Saada that are affiliated with Iran. The attacks, per Redmond, singled out OT equipment deployed across different sectors in Israel that were manufactured by international vendors as well as those that were sourced from Israel but deployed in other countries. These OT devices are ""primarily internet-exposed OT systems with poor security posture, potentially accompanied by weak passwords and known vulnerabilities,"" the tech giant added. To mitigate the risks posed by such threats, it's recommended that organizations ensure security hygiene for their OT systems, specifically by reducing the attack surface and implementing zero trust practices to prevent attackers from moving laterally within a compromised network. The development comes as OT security firm Claroty unpacked a destructive malware strain called Fuxnet that the Blackjack hacking group, suspected to be backed by Ukraine, allegedly used against Moscollector, a Russian company that maintains a large network of sensors for monitoring Moscow's underground water and sewage systems for emergency detection and response. BlackJack, which shared details of the attack early last month, described Fuxnet as ""Stuxnet on steroids,"" with Claroty noting that the malware was likely deployed remotely to the target sensor gateways using protocols such as SSH or the sensor protocol (SBK) over port 4321. Fuxnet comes with the capability to irrevocably destroy the filesystem, block access to the device, and physically destroy the NAND memory chips on the device by constantly writing and rewriting the memory in order to render it inoperable. On top of that, it's designed to rewrite the UBI volume to prevent the sensor from rebooting, and ultimately corrupt the sensors themselves by sending a flood of bogus Meter-Bus (M-Bus) messages. ""The attackers developed and deployed malware that targeted the gateways and deleted filesystems, directories, disabled remote access services, routing services for each device, and rewrote flash memory, destroyed NAND memory chips, UBI volumes and other actions that further disrupted operation of these gateways,"" Claroty noted. According to data shared by Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky earlier this week, the internet, email clients, and removable storage devices emerged as the primary sources of threats to computers in an organization's OT infrastructure in the first quarter of 2024. ""Malicious actors use scripts for a wide range of objectives: collecting information, tracking, redirecting the browser to a malicious site, and uploading various types of malware (spyware and/or silent crypto mining tools) to the user's system or browser,"" it said. ""These spread via the internet and email.""",https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/microsoft-warns-of-surge-in-cyber.html,"Microsoft has emphasized the importance of securing internet-exposed operational technology (OT) devices due to a spate of recent cyber attacks targeting such environments.

Tracked as CVE-2024-24919 (CVSS score: 7.5), the issue impacts CloudGuard Network, Quantum Maestro, Quantum Scalable Chassis, Quantum Security Gateways, and Quantum Spark appliances. ""The vulnerability potentially allows an attacker to read certain information on Internet-connected Gateways with remote access VPN or mobile access enabled,"" Check Point said. Hotfixes are available in the following versions - The development comes days after the Israeli cybersecurity company warned of attacks targeting its VPN devices to infiltrate enterprise networks. ""By May 24, 2024, we identified a small number of login attempts using old VPN local-accounts relying on unrecommended password-only authentication method,"" it noted earlier this week. This has now been traced back to a new high-severity zero-day discovered in Security Gateways with IPSec VPN, Remote Access VPN and the Mobile Access software blade. Check Point did not elaborate on the nature of the attacks, but noted in an FAQ that the exploitation attempts observed so far focus on ""remote access on old local accounts with unrecommended password-only authentication"" against a ""small number of customers."" The targeting of VPN devices represents just the latest series of attacks to target network perimeter applications, with similar intrusions impacting devices from Barracuda Networks, Cisco, Fortinet, Ivanti, Palo Alto Networks, and VMware in recent years. ""Attackers are motivated to gain access to organizations over remote-access setups so they can try to discover relevant enterprise assets and users, seeking for vulnerabilities in order to gain persistence on key enterprise assets,"" Check Point said. In an advisory published on Wednesday, cybersecurity firm mnemonic said it observed exploitation attempts involving CVE-2024-24919 and targeting its customer environments since April 30, 2024. ""The vulnerability is considered critical because it allows unauthorized actors to extract information from gateways connected to the internet,"" the company said. ""The vulnerability allows a threat actor to enumerate and extract password hashes for all local accounts, including the account used to connect to Active Directory."" ""However, it is known that password hashes of legacy local users with password-only authentication can be extracted, including service accounts used to connect to Active Directory. Weak passwords can be compromised, leading to further misuse and potential lateral movement within the network."" The Norwegian company further described the shortcoming as critical and trivial to exploit owing to the fact that it does not require user interaction or privileges. Evidence gathered so far shows that the vulnerability has also weaponized to extract Active Directory data (NTDS.dit) within 2-3 hours after logging in with a local user, subsequently allowing unknown actors to move laterally in the network and misuse remote development extensions in Visual Studio (VS) Code to tunnel network traffic for detection evasion.

"The Ultimate SaaS Security Posture Management Checklist, 2025 Edition","cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","Since the first edition of The Ultimate SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) Checklist was released three years ago, the corporate SaaS sprawl has been growing at a double-digit pace. In large enterprises, the number of SaaS applications in use today is in the hundreds, spread across departmental stacks, complicating the job of security teams to protect organizations against evolving threats. As SaaS security becomes a top priority, enterprises are turning to SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) as an enabler. The 2025 Ultimate SaaS Security Checklist, designed to help organizations choose an SSPM, covers all the features and capabilities that should be included in these solutions. Before diving into each attack surface, when implementing an SSPM solution, it's essential to cover a breadth of integrations, including out-of-the-box and custom app integrations, as well as in-depth security checks. While there are apps that are more sensitive and complex to secure, a breach can come from any app, therefore coverage is key. The essential prevention capabilities of an SSPM to secure the entire SaaS stack should cover the following: Serving as the core of an SSPM, misconfiguration management should provide deep visibility and control of all security settings across all SaaS apps for all users. It should have wide functionalities such as posture score, automated security checks, severity measurement, compliance checks, alerting, in addition to SOAR/SIEM and any ticketing system integration to fix misconfigurations using existing security tools. Such platforms should include detailed remediation plans and a robust app owner-security team collaboration infrastructure to ensure the remediation loop is properly closed. Strong Identity Security Posture Management (ISPM) capabilities are of paramount importance in securing the SaaS stack. In regards to human identities, an organization needs to have the ability to govern overprivileged users, dormant users, joiners, movers, leavers, and external users, and trim permissions accordingly. This also includes enforcement of identity-centric configurations such as MFA and SSO, especially for those who have sensitive roles or access. As users install apps, with or without the knowledge and consent of the security team, an SSPM should have the ability to monitor the non-human identities associated with connecting 3rd party apps to core hubs to mitigate risk. A SaaS security tool should have automated app discovery and management to enable security teams to see all sanctioned and shadow apps, scopes and permissions, and remediate accordingly.  Getting SaaS entitlements all in one place enhances identity security posture management to reduce the attack surface and improve compliance efforts. Sophisticated applications, such as Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Workday, Google Workspace, ServiceNow, Zendesk, and more have very complex permission structures, with layers of permissions, profiles, and permission sets. Unified visibility for the discovery of complex permissions enables security teams to better understand risk coming from any user. When selecting an SSPM, make sure that it integrates with the Unified Endpoint Management system, to ensure you manage risks from your SaaS user devices. Through such a feature, the security team has insights into SaaS-user unmanaged, low-hygiene and vulnerable devices that can be susceptible to data theft.  SaaS providers are racing to add generative AI capabilities into SaaS applications to capitalize on the wave of productivity offered by this new form of AI. Add-ons such as Salesforce Einstein Copilot and Microsoft Copilot use GenAI to create reports, write proposals, and email customers. The ease of using GenAI tools has increased the risk of data leakage, expanded the attack surface, and opened new areas for exploitation.  When evaluating a SaaS security solution, make sure it includes GenAI monitoring, including:  SaaS applications contain sensitive information that could cause considerable harm to the company if made public. Additionally, many SaaS users share files from their SaaS applications with external users, such as contractors or agencies, as part of their operational process. Security teams need visibility into the shared settings of documents that are publicly available or externally shared. This visibility enables them to close gaps in document security and prevent data leaks from occurring. An SPPM should be able to pinpoint documents, files, repositories, and other assets that are publicly available or shared with external users. A SaaS security solution should include capabilities in the area of data leakage protection such as: Download the full 2025 SaaS security checklist edition. Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) provides a second layer of protection to the SaaS stack that serves as a critical piece of the identity fabric. When threat actors breach an application, ITDR detects and responds to identity-related threats based on detecting key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA). This triggers an alert and sets the incident response mechanism in motion.  An SSPM should include ITDR capabilities that are based on logs coming from the entire SaaS stack, this is another reason why stack coverage is so important. By extending the rich data collected across the SaaS stack, ITDR capabilities have a far richer understanding of standard user behavior and the detection of anomalies in the most accurate way. Sample Indicators of Compromise include: By developing best practices for SaaS security, organizations can grow safely with SaaS applications. To compare and choose the right SSPM for your organization, check out the full 2025 checklist edition outlining what capabilities to look for to elevate your SaaS security and be prepared to head off new challenges. Get the complete guide along with the printable checklist here.",https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/the-ultimate-saas-security-posture.html,"The Ultimate SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM) Checklist has been updated for 2025 to help organizations secure their growing SaaS sprawl. The checklist covers all the features and capabilities that should be included in SSPM solutions, including a breadth of integrations, misconfiguration management, identity security posture management, app discovery and management, unified endpoint management, generative AI monitoring, data leakage protection, and identity threat detection and response. These capabilities are essential for securing the entire SaaS stack and reducing the attack surface. The checklist is designed to help organizations choose an SSPM solution that meets their specific needs and provides the necessary protection against evolving threats."
Hackers Created Rogue VMs to Evade Detection in Recent MITRE Cyber Attack,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","The MITRE Corporation has revealed that the cyber attack targeting the not-for-profit company towards late December 2023 by exploiting zero-day flaws in Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) involved the threat actor creating rogue virtual machines (VMs) within its VMware environment. ""The adversary created their own rogue VMs within the VMware environment, leveraging compromised vCenter Server access,"" MITRE researchers Lex Crumpton and Charles Clancy said. ""They wrote and deployed a JSP web shell (BEEFLUSH) under the vCenter Server's Tomcat server to execute a Python-based tunneling tool, facilitating SSH connections between adversary-created VMs and the ESXi hypervisor infrastructure."" The motive behind such a move is to sidestep detection by obscuring their malicious activities from centralized management interfaces like vCenter and maintain persistent access while reducing the risk of being discovered. Details of the attack emerged last month when MITRE revealed that the China-nexus threat actor -- tracked by Google-owned Mandiant under the name UNC5221 -- breached its Networked Experimentation, Research, and Virtualization Environment (NERVE) by exploiting two ICS flaws CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887. Upon bypassing multi-factor authentication and gaining an initial foothold, the adversary moved laterally across the network and leveraged a compromised administrator account to take control of the VMware infrastructure and deploy various backdoors and web shells to retain access and harvest credentials. This consisted of a Golang-based backdoor codenamed BRICKSTORM that was embedded within the rogue VMs and two web shells referred to as BEEFLUSH and BUSHWALK, allowing UNC5221 to execute arbitrary commands and communicate with command-and-control servers. ""The adversary also used a default VMware account, VPXUSER, to make seven API calls that enumerated a list of mounted and unmounted drives,"" MITRE said. ""Rogue VMs operate outside the standard management processes and do not adhere to established security policies, making them difficult to detect and manage through the GUI alone. Instead, one needs special tools or techniques to identify and mitigate the risks associated with rogue VMs effectively."" One effective countermeasure against threat actors' stealthy efforts to bypass detection and maintain access is to enable secure boot, which prevents unauthorized modifications by verifying the integrity of the boot process. The company said it's also making available two PowerShell scripts named Invoke-HiddenVMQuery and VirtualGHOST to help identify and mitigate potential threats within the VMware environment. ""As adversaries continue to evolve their tactics and techniques, it is imperative for organizations to remain vigilant and adaptive in defending against cyber threats,"" MITRE said.",https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/hackers-created-rogue-vms-to-evade.html,"The MITRE Corporation was targeted by a cyber attack in late December 2023, exploiting zero-day flaws in Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS).

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-4323, has been codenamed Linguistic Lumberjack by Tenable Research. It impacts versions from 2.0.7 through 3.0.3, with fixes available in version 3.0.4. The issue relates to a case of memory corruption in Fluent Bit's built-in HTTP server that could allow for DoS, information leakage, or remote code execution. Specifically, it relates to sending maliciously crafted requests to the monitoring API through endpoints such as /api/v1/traces and /api/v1/trace. ""Regardless of whether or not any traces are configured, it is still possible for any user with access to this API endpoint to query it,"" security researcher Jimi Sebree said. ""During the parsing of incoming requests for the /api/v1/traces endpoint, the data types of input names are not properly validated before being parsed."" By default, the data types are assumed to be strings (i.e., MSGPACK_OBJECT_STR), which a threat actor could exploit by passing non-string values, leading to memory corruption. Tenable said it was able to reliably exploit the issue to crash the service and cause a DoS condition. Remote code execution, on the other hand, is dependent on a variety of environmental factors such as host architecture and operating system. Users are recommended to update to the latest version to mitigate potential security threats, especially given that a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit has been made available for the flaw.",https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/linguistic-lumberjack-vulnerability.html,"A critical security flaw, CVE-2024-4323, has been discovered in Fluent Bit, a popular logging and metrics utility.

The website (""breachforums[.]st"") has been replaced by a seizure banner stating the clearnet cybercrime forum is under the control of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  The operation is the result of a collaborative effort from authorities in Australia, Iceland, New Zealand, Switzerland, the U.K., the U.S., and Ukraine. The FBI has also taken control of the Telegram channel operated by Baphomet, who became the administrator of the forum following the arrest of his predecessor Conor Brian Fitzpatrick (aka pompompurin) in March last year. It's worth noting a prior iteration of BreachForums, hosted at breached.vc/.to/.co and managed by pompompurin, was seized by law enforcement in late June 2023. ""This Telegram chat is under the control of the FBI,"" a message posted on the channel reads. ""The BreachForums website has been taken down by the FBI and DOJ with assistance from international partners."" ""We are reviewing the site's backend data.

Of the 61 flaws, one is rated Critical, 59 are rated Important, and one is rated Moderate in severity. This is in addition to 30 vulnerabilities resolved in the Chromium-based Edge browser over the past month, including two recently disclosed zero-days (CVE-2024-4671 and CVE-2024-4761) that have been tagged as exploited in attacks. The two security shortcomings that have been weaponized in the wild are below - ""An unauthenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain code execution through convincing a user to open a malicious document at which point the attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the user,"" the tech giant said in an advisory for CVE-2024-30040. However, successful exploitation requires an attacker to convince the user to load a specially crafted file onto a vulnerable system, distributed either via email or an instant message, and trick them into manipulating it. Interestingly, the victim doesn't have to click or open the malicious file to activate the infection. On the other hand, CVE-2024-30051 could allow a threat actor to gain SYSTEM privileges. Three groups of researchers from Kaspersky, DBAPPSecurity WeBin Lab, Google Threat Analysis Group, and Mandiant have been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw, indicating likely widespread exploitation. ""We have seen it used together with QakBot and other malware, and believe that multiple threat actors have access to it,"" Kaspersky researchers Boris Larin and Mert Degirmenci said. Both vulnerabilities have been added by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the latest fixes by June 4, 2024. Also resolved by Microsoft are several remote code execution bugs, including nine impacting Windows Mobile Broadband Driver and seven affecting Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS). Other notable flaws encompass privilege escalation flaws in the Common Log File System (CLFS) driver – CVE-2024-29996, CVE-2024-30025 (CVSS scores: 7.8), and CVE-2024-30037 (CVSS score: 7.5) – Win32k (CVE-2024-30028 and CVE-2024-30030, CVSS scores: 7.8), Windows Search Service (CVE-2024-30033, CVSS score: 7.0), and Windows Kernel (CVE-2024-30018, CVSS score: 7.8). In March 2024, Kaspersky revealed that threat actors are attempting to actively exploit now-patched privilege escalation flaws in various Windows components owing to the fact that ""it's a very easy way to get a quick NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM."" Akamai has further outlined a new privilege escalation technique affecting Active Directory (AD) environments that takes advantage of the DHCP administrators group. ""In cases where the DHCP server role is installed on a Domain Controller (DC), this could enable them to gain domain admin privileges,"" the company noted. ""In addition to providing a privilege escalation primitive, the same technique could also be used to create a stealthy domain persistence mechanism."" Rounding off the list is a security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-30050, CVSS score: 5.4) impacting Windows Mark-of-the-Web (MotW) that could be exploited by means of a malicious file to evade defenses. Microsoft, which was recently castigated for a series of security lapses that led to a breach of its infrastructure by nation-state actors from China and Russia, has laid out a series of steps to prioritize security above all other product features as part of its Secure Future Initiative (SFI). ""In addition, we will instill accountability by basing part of the compensation of the company’s Senior Leadership Team on our progress in meeting our security plans and milestones,"" Charlie Bell, executive vice president of Microsoft Security, said.

Malicious Python Package Hides Sliver C2 Framework in Fake Requests Library Logo,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","Cybersecurity researchers have identified a malicious Python package that purports to be an offshoot of the popular requests library and has been found concealing a Golang-version of the Sliver command-and-control (C2) framework within a PNG image of the project's logo.  The package employing this steganographic trickery is requests-darwin-lite, which has been downloaded 417 times prior to it being taken down from the Python Package Index (PyPI) registry. Requests-darwin-lite ""appeared to be a fork of the ever-popular requests package with a few key differences, most notably the inclusion of a malicious Go binary packed into a large version of the actual requests side-bar PNG logo,"" software supply chain security firm Phylum said. The changes have been introduced in the package's setup.py file, which has been configured to decode and execute a Base64-encoded command to gather the system's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), but only after confirming that the compromised host is running Apple macOS. The finding also comes a little over a month after the company discovered a rogue npm package named vue2util that poses as a helper utility but is designed to carry out a cryptojacking scheme and steal a victim's USDT tokens. The package ""exploits the ERC20 contract (USDT) approval mechanism, covertly granting unlimited approval to the attacker’s contract address, effectively allowing the attacker to drain the victim’s USDT tokens,"" Phylum noted. In what's an interesting twist, the infection chain proceeds only if the identifier matches a particular value, implying that the author(s) behind the package is looking to breach a specific machine to which they are already in possession of the identifier obtained through some other means. This raises two possibilities: Either it's a highly targeted attack or it's some sort of a testing process ahead of a broader campaign. Should the UUID match, the requests-darwin-lite proceeds to read data from a PNG file named ""requests-sidebar-large.png,"" which bears similarities with the legitimate requests package that ships with a similar file called ""requests-sidebar.png.""  What's different here is that while the real logo embedded within requests has a file size of 300 kB, the one contained inside requests-darwin-lite is around 17 MB. The binary data concealed in the PNG image is the Golang-based Sliver, an open-source C2 framework that's designed to be used by security professionals in their red team operations. The exact end goal of the package is currently unclear, but the development is once again a sign that open-source ecosystems continue to be an attractive vector to distribute malware. With a vast majority of codebases relying on open-source code, the steady influx of malware into npm, PyPI, and other package registries, not to mention the recent XZ Utils episode, has highlighted the need for addressing issues in a systematic manner that otherwise can ""derail large swaths of the web.""

Kremlin-Backed APT28 Targets Polish Institutions in Large-Scale Malware Campaign,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","Polish government institutions have been targeted as part of a large-scale malware campaign orchestrated by a Russia-linked nation-state actor called APT28. ""The campaign sent emails with content intended to arouse the recipient's interest and persuade him to click on the link,"" the computer emergency response team, CERT Polska, said in a Wednesday bulletin. Clicking on the link redirects the victim to the domain run.mocky[.]io, which, in turn, is used to redirect to another legitimate site named webhook[.]site, a free service that allows developers to inspect data that's being sent via a webhook, in an effort to evade detection. The next step involves the download of a ZIP archive file from webhook[.]site, which contains the Windows Calculator binary that masquerades as a JPG image file (""IMG-238279780.jpg.exe""), a hidden batch script file, and another hidden DLL file (""WindowsCodecs.dll""). Should a victim run the application, the malicious DLL file is side-loaded by means of a technique called DLL side-loading to ultimately run the batch script, while images of an ""actual woman in a swimsuit along with links to her real accounts on social media platforms"" are displayed in a web browser to maintain the ruse. The batch script simultaneously downloads a JPG image (""IMG-238279780.jpg"") from webhook[.]site that's subsequently renamed to a CMD script (""IMG-238279780.cmd) and executed, following which it retrieves the final-stage payload to gather information about the compromised host and send the details back. CERT Polska said the attack chain bears similarities to a previous campaign that propagated a custom backdoor called HeadLace.  It's worth noting that the abuse of legitimate services like Mocky and webhook[.]site is a tactic repeatedly adopted by APT28 actors so as to sidestep detection by security software. ""If your organization does not use the above-mentioned services, we recommend that you consider blocking the above-mentioned domains on edge devices,"" it added. ""Regardless of whether you use the above-mentioned websites, we also recommend filtering emails for links in webhook.site and run.mocky.io, because cases of their legitimate use in the email content are very rare."" The development comes days after NATO countries accused the Kremlin-backed group of conducting a long-term cyber espionage campaign targeting their political entities, state institutions, and critical infrastructure. APT28's malicious activities have also expanded to target iOS devices with the XAgent spyware, which was first detailed by Trend Micro in connection with a campaign dubbed Operation Pawn Storm in February 2015. ""Primarily targeting political and government entities in Western Europe, XAgent possesses capabilities for remote control and data exfiltration,"" Broadcom-owned Symantec said. ""It can gather information on users' contacts, messages, device details, installed applications, screenshots, and call records. This data could potentially be used for social engineering or spear-phishing campaigns."" News of APT28's attacks on Polish entities also follows a spike in financially motivated attacks by Russian e-crime groups like UAC-0006 targeting Ukraine in the second half of 2023, even as organizations in Russia and Belarus have been targeted by a nation-state actor known as Midge to deliver malware capable of plundering sensitive information.",https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/kremlin-backed-apt28-targets-polish.html,"APT28, a Russia-linked nation-state actor, has targeted Polish government institutions in a large-scale malware campaign.

"Microsoft Outlook Flaw Exploited by Russia's APT28 to Hack Czech, German Entities","cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","Czechia and Germany on Friday revealed that they were the target of a long-term cyber espionage campaign conducted by the Russia-linked nation-state actor known as APT28, drawing condemnation from the European Union (E.U.), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the U.K., and the U.S. The Czech Republic's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), in a statement, said some unnamed entities in the country have been attacked using a security flaw in Microsoft Outlook that came to light early last year. ""Cyber attacks targeting political entities, state institutions and critical infrastructure are not only a threat to national security, but also disrupt the democratic processes on which our free society is based,"" the MFA said. The security flaw in question is CVE-2023-23397, a now-patched critical privilege escalation bug in Outlook that could allow an adversary to access Net-NTLMv2 hashes and then use them to authenticate themselves by means of a relay attack. Germany's Federal Government (aka Bundesregierung) attributed the threat actor to a cyber attack aimed at the Executive Committee of the Social Democratic Party using the same Outlook vulnerability for a ""relatively long period,"" allowing it to ""compromise numerous email accounts."" Some of the industry verticals targeted as part of the campaign include logistics, armaments, the air and space industry, IT services, foundations, and associations located in Germany, Ukraine, and Europe, with the Bundesregierung also implicating the group to the 2015 attack on the German federal parliament (Bundestag). APT28, assessed to be linked to Military Unit 26165 of the Russian Federation's military intelligence agency GRU, is also tracked by the broader cybersecurity community under the names BlueDelta, Fancy Bear, Forest Blizzard (formerly Strontium), FROZENLAKE, Iron Twilight, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy, and TA422. Late last month, Microsoft attributed the hacking group to the exploitation of a Microsoft Windows Print Spooler component (CVE-2022-38028, CVSS score: 7.8) as a zero-day to deliver a previously unknown custom malware called GooseEgg to infiltrate Ukrainian, Western European, and North American government, non-governmental, education, and transportation sector organizations. NATO said Russia's hybrid actions ""constitute a threat to Allied security."" The Council of the European Union also chimed in, stating the ""malicious cyber campaign shows Russia's continuous pattern of irresponsible behavior in cyberspace.""  ""Recent activity by Russian GRU cyber group APT28, including the targeting of the German Social Democratic Party executive, is the latest in a known pattern of behavior by the Russian Intelligence Services to undermine democratic processes across the globe,"" the U.K. government said. The U.S. Department of State described APT28 as known to engage in ""malicious, nefarious, destabilizing and disruptive behavior"" and that it's committed to the ""security of our allies and partners and upholding the rules-based international order, including in cyberspace."" Earlier this February, a coordinated law enforcement action disrupted a botnet comprising hundreds of small office and home office (SOHO) routers in the U.S. and Germany that the APT28 actors are believed to have used to conceal their malicious activities, which, among others, comprised the exploitation of CVE-2023-23397 against targets of interest. According to a report from cybersecurity firm Trend Micro this week, the third-party criminal proxy botnet dates back to 2016 and consists of more than just routers from Ubiquiti, encompassing other Linux-based routers, Raspberry Pi devices, and virtual private servers (VPS). ""The threat actor [behind the botnet] managed to move over some of the EdgeRouter bots from the C&C [command-and-control] server that was taken down on January 26, 2024, to a newly set up C&C infrastructure in early February 2024,"" the company said, adding legal constraints and technical challenges prevented a thorough cleanup of all ensnared routers. Russian state-sponsored cyber threat activity – data theft, destructive attacks, DDoS campaigns, and influence operations – is also expected to pose a severe risk to elections in regions like the U.S., the U.K., and the E.U. from multiple groups such as APT28, APT29, APT44 (aka Sandworm), COLDRIVER, and KillNet, per an assessment released by Google Cloud subsidiary Mandiant last week. ""In 2016, GRU-linked APT28 compromised U.S. Democratic Party organization targets as well as the personal account of the Democratic presidential candidate's campaign chairman and orchestrated a leak campaign ahead of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election,"" researchers Kelli Vanderlee and Jamie Collier said. What's more, data from Cloudflare and NETSCOUT show a surge in DDoS attacks targeting Sweden following its acceptance to the NATO alliance, mirroring the pattern observed during Finland's NATO accession in 2023. ""The likely culprits of these attacks included the hacker groups NoName057, Anonymous Sudan, Russian Cyber Army Team, and KillNet,"" NETSCOUT said. ""All these groups are politically motivated, supporting Russian ideals."" A report released by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) in December 2023 said that DDoS attacks are increasingly fueled by warfare and geopolitical motivations, stating the current DoS threat landscape is influenced to a great extent by the emergence of recent armed conflicts around the world, allowing threat actors to choose targets without any repercussions. The developments come as government agencies from Canada, the U.K., and the U.S. have released a new joint fact sheet to help secure critical infrastructure organizations from continued attacks launched by apparent pro-Russia hacktivists against industrial control systems (ICS) and small-scale operational technology (OT) systems since 2022. ""The pro-Russia hacktivist activity appears mostly limited to unsophisticated techniques that manipulate ICS equipment to create nuisance effects,"" the agencies said. ""However, investigations have identified that these actors are capable of techniques that pose physical threats against insecure and misconfigured OT environments."" Targets of these attacks comprise organizations in North American and European critical infrastructure sectors, including water and wastewater systems, dams, energy, and food and agriculture sectors. The hacktivist groups have been observed gaining remote access by exploiting publicly exposed internet-facing connections as well as factory default passwords associated with human machine interfaces (HMIs) prevalent in such environments, followed by tampering with mission-critical parameters, turning off alarm mechanisms, and locking out operators by changing administrative passwords. Recommendations to mitigate the threat include hardening human machine interfaces, limiting exposure of OT systems to the internet, using strong and unique passwords, and implementing multi-factor authentication for all access to the OT network. ""These hacktivists seek to compromise modular, internet-exposed industrial control systems (ICS) through their software components, such as human machine interfaces (HMIs), by exploiting virtual network computing (VNC) remote access software and default passwords,"" the alert said.",https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/microsoft-outlook-flaw-exploited-by.html,"Czechia and Germany have revealed that they were the target of a long-term cyber espionage campaign conducted by the Russia-linked nation-state actor known as APT28. The campaign targeted entities in the Czech Republic and Germany using a security flaw in Microsoft Outlook (CVE-2023-23397) to compromise numerous email accounts. The European Union, NATO, the U.K., and the U.S. have condemned the attacks, with NATO stating that Russia's hybrid actions ""constitute a threat to Allied security."" APT28, also known as Fancy Bear, is linked to Military Unit 26165 of the Russian Federation's military intelligence agency GRU. The group has been linked to previous attacks, including the 2015 attack on the German federal parliament and the exploitation of a Microsoft Windows Print Spooler component in late 2022. A coordinated law enforcement action in January 2024 disrupted a botnet used by APT28 to conceal their malicious activities. Russian state-sponsored cyber threat activity is expected to pose a severe risk to elections in regions like the U.S., the U.K., and the E.U. from multiple groups such as APT28, APT29, APT44, COLDRIVER, and KillNet.

Dropbox Discloses Breach of Digital Signature Service Affecting All Users,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","Cloud storage services provider Dropbox on Wednesday disclosed that Dropbox Sign (formerly HelloSign) was breached by unidentified threat actors, who accessed emails, usernames, and general account settings associated with all users of the digital signature product. The company, in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said it became aware of the ""unauthorized access"" on April 24, 2024. Dropbox announced its plans to acquire HelloSign in January 2019. ""The threat actor had accessed data related to all users of Dropbox Sign, such as emails and usernames, in addition to general account settings,"" it said in the Form 8-K filing.. ""For subsets of users, the threat actor also accessed phone numbers, hashed passwords, and certain authentication information such as API keys, OAuth tokens, and multi-factor authentication."" Even worse, the intrusion also affects third-parties who received or signed a document through Dropbox Sign, but never created an account themselves, specifically exposing their names and email addresses. Investigation conducted so far has uncovered no evidence that the attackers accessed the contents of users' accounts, such as agreements or templates, or their payment information. The incident is also said to be restricted to Dropbox Sign infrastructure. The attackers are believed to have gained access to a Dropbox Sign automated system configuration tool and compromised a service account that's part of Sign's backend, exploiting the account's elevated privileges to access its customer database. The company, however, did not disclose how many customers were affected by the hack, but said it's in the process of reaching out to all impacted users alongside ""step-by-step instructions"" to protect their information. ""Our security team also reset users' passwords, logged users out of any devices they had connected to Dropbox Sign, and is coordinating the rotation of all API keys and OAuth tokens,"" it said. Dropbox also said it's cooperating with law enforcement and regulatory authorities on the matter. Further analysis of the breach remains ongoing. The breach is the second such incident to target Dropbox within two years. In November 2022, the company divulged it was the victim of a phishing campaign that allowed unidentified threat actors to gain unauthorized access to 130 of its source code repositories on GitHub.",https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/dropbox-discloses-breach-of-digital.html,"Dropbox Sign, a digital signature product owned by Dropbox, experienced a data breach on April 24, 2024.

Android Malware Wpeeper Uses Compromised WordPress Sites to Hide C2 Servers,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a previously undocumented malware targeting Android devices that uses compromised WordPress sites as relays for its actual command-and-control (C2) servers for detection evasion. The malware, codenamed Wpeeper, is an ELF binary that leverages the HTTPS protocol to secure its C2 communications. ""Wpeeper is a typical backdoor Trojan for Android systems, supporting functions such as collecting sensitive device information, managing files and directories, uploading and downloading, and executing commands,"" researchers from the QiAnXin XLab team said. The ELF binary is embedded within a repackaged application that purports to be the UPtodown App Store app for Android (package name ""com.uptodown""), with the APK file acting as a delivery vehicle for the backdoor in a manner that evades detection. The Chinese cybersecurity firm said it discovered the malware after it detected a Wpeeper artifact with zero detection on the VirusTotal platform on April 18, 2024. The campaign is said to have come to an abrupt end four days later. The use of the Uptodown App Store app for the campaign indicates an attempt to pass off a legitimate third-party app marketplace and trick unsuspecting users into installing it. According to stats on Android-apk.org, the trojanized version of the app (5.92) has been downloaded 2,609 times to date. Wpeeper relies on a multi-tier C2 architecture that uses infected WordPress sites as an intermediary to obscure its true C2 servers. As many as 45 C2 servers have been identified as part of the infrastructure, nine of which are hard-coded into the samples and are used to update the C2 list on the fly.  ""These [hard-coded servers] are not C2s but C2 redirectors -- their role is to forward the bot's requests to the real C2, aimed at shielding the actual C2 from detection,"" the researchers said. This has also raised the possibility that some of the hard-coded servers are directly under their control, since there is a risk of losing access to the botnet should WordPress site administrators get wind of the compromise and take steps to correct it. The commands retrieved from the C2 server allow the malware to collect device and file information, list of installed apps, update the C2 server, download and execute additional payloads from the C2 server or an arbitrary URL, and self-delete itself. The exact goals and scale of the campaign are presently unknown, although it's suspected that the sneaky method may have been used to increase the installation numbers and then reveal the malware's capabilities. To mitigate the risks posed by such malware, it's always advised to install apps only from trusted sources, and scrutinize app reviews and permissions prior to downloading them. A Google spokesperson shared the below statement following the publication of the story - Based on our current detection, no apps containing this malware are found on Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.",https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/android-malware-wpeeper-uses.html,"Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new malware called Wpeeper that targets Android devices and uses compromised WordPress sites as relays for its command-and-control servers to evade detection.

New U.K. Law Bans Default Passwords on Smart Devices Starting April 2024,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is calling on manufacturers of smart devices to comply with new legislation that prohibits them from using default passwords, effective April 29, 2024. ""The law, known as the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure act (or PSTI act), will help consumers to choose smart devices that have been designed to provide ongoing protection against cyber attacks,"" the NCSC said. To that end, manufacturers are required to not supply devices that use guessable default passwords, provide a point of contact to report security issues, and state the duration for which their devices are expected to receive important security updates. Default passwords can not only be easily found online, they also act as a vector for threat actors to log in to devices for follow-on exploitation. That said, a unique default password is permissible under the law. The law, which aims to enforce a set of minimum security standards across the board and prevent vulnerable devices from being corralled into a DDoS botnet like Mirai, applies to the following products that can be connected to the internet - Companies that fail to adhere to the provisions of the PSTI act are liable to face recalls and monetary penalties, attracting fines of up to �10 million ($12.5 million) or 4% of their global annual revenues, depending on whichever is higher. The development makes the U.K. the first country in the world to outlaw default usernames and passwords from IoT devices. According to Cloudflare's DDoS threat report for Q1 2024, Mirai-based attacks continue to be prevalent despite the original botnet being taken down in 2016. ""Four out of every 100 HTTP DDoS attacks, and two out of every 100 L3/4 DDoS attacks are launched by a Mirai-variant botnet,"" Omer Yoachimik and Jorge Pacheco said. ""The Mirai source code was made public, and over the years there have been many permutations of the original."" It also follows a $196 million fine issued by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) against telecom carriers AT&T ($57 million), Sprint ($12 million), T-Mobile ($80 million), and Verizon ($47 million) for illegally sharing customers' real-time location data without their consent to aggregators like LocationSmart and Zumigo, who then sold the information to third-party location-based service providers. ""No one who signed up for a cell plan thought they were giving permission for their phone company to sell a detailed record of their movements to anyone with a credit card,"" U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, who revealed the practice in 2018, said in a statement.",https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/new-uk-law-bans-default-passwords-on.html,"The U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has announced new legislation that prohibits manufacturers from using default passwords on smart devices, effective April 29, 2024.

Hackers Exploiting WP-Automatic Plugin Bug to Create Admin Accounts on WordPress Sites,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","Threat actors are attempting to actively exploit a critical security flaw in the ValvePress Automatic plugin for WordPress that could allow site takeovers. The shortcoming, tracked as CVE-2024-27956, carries a CVSS score of 9.9 out of a maximum of 10. It impacts all versions of the plugin prior to 3.92.0. The issue has been resolved in version 3.92.1 released on February 27, 2024, although the release notes make no mention of it. ""This vulnerability, a SQL injection (SQLi) flaw, poses a severe threat as attackers can exploit it to gain unauthorized access to websites, create admin‑level user accounts, upload malicious files, and potentially take full control of affected sites,"" WPScan said in an alert this week. According to the Automattic-owned company, the issue is rooted in the plugin's user authentication mechanism, which can be trivially circumvented to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database by means of specially crafted requests. In the attacks observed so far, CVE-2024-27956 is being used to unauthorized database queries and create new admin accounts on susceptible WordPress sites (e.g., names starting with ""xtw""), which could then be leveraged for follow-on post-exploitation actions. This includes installing plugins that make it possible to upload files or edit code, indicating attempts to repurpose the infected sites as stagers. ""Once a WordPress site is compromised, attackers ensure the longevity of their access by creating backdoors and obfuscating the code,"" WPScan said. ""To evade detection and maintain access, attackers may also rename the vulnerable WP‑Automatic file, making it difficult for website owners or security tools to identify or block the issue."" The file in question is ""/wp‑content/plugins/wp‑automatic/inc/csv.php,"" which is renamed to something like ""/wp‑content/plugins/wp‑automatic/inc/csv65f82ab408b3.php."" That said, it's possible that the threat actors are doing so in an attempt to prevent other attackers from exploiting the sites already under their control. CVE-2024-27956 was publicly disclosed by WordPress security firm Patchstack on March 13, 2024. Since then, more than 5.5 million attack attempts to weaponize the flaw have been detected in the wild. The disclosure comes as severe bugs have been disclosed in plugins like Email Subscribers by Icegram Express (CVE-2024-2876, CVSS score: 9.8), Forminator (CVE-2024-28890, CVSS score: 9.8), and User Registration (CVE-2024-2417, CVSS score: 8.8) that could be used to extract sensitive data like password hashes from the database, upload arbitrary files, and grant an authenticator user admin privileges. Patchstack has also warned of an unpatched issue in the Poll Maker plugin (CVE-2024-32514, CVSS score: 9.9) that allows for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server, leading to remote code execution.

State-Sponsored Hackers Exploit Two Cisco Zero-Day Vulnerabilities for Espionage,"cyber security news, cyber news, cyber security news today, cyber security updates, cyber updates, hacker news, hacking news, software vulnerability, cyber attacks, data breach, ransomware malware, how to hack, network security, information security, the hacker news, computer security","A new malware campaign leveraged two zero-day flaws in Cisco networking gear to deliver custom malware and facilitate covert data collection on target environments. Cisco Talos, which dubbed the activity ArcaneDoor, attributed it as the handiwork of a previously undocumented sophisticated state-sponsored actor it tracks under the name UAT4356 (aka Storm-1849 by Microsoft). ""UAT4356 deployed two backdoors as components of this campaign, 'Line Runner' and 'Line Dancer,' which were used collectively to conduct malicious actions on-target, which included configuration modification, reconnaissance, network traffic capture/exfiltration and potentially lateral movement,"" Talos said. The intrusions, which were first detected and confirmed in early January 2024, entail the exploitation of two vulnerabilities - It's worth noting that a zero-day exploit is the technique or attack a malicious actor deploys to leverage an unknown security vulnerability to gain access into a system. While the second flaw allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with root-level privileges, administrator-level privileges are required to exploit it. Addressed alongside CVE-2024-20353 and CVE-2024-20359 is a command injection flaw in the same appliance (CVE-2024-20358, CVSS score: 6.0) that was uncovered during internal security testing. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added the shortcomings to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the vendor-provided fixes by May 1, 2024. The exact initial access pathway used to breach the devices is presently unknown, although UAT4356 is said to have started preparations for it as early as July 2023.  A successful foothold is followed by the deployment of two implants named Line Dancer and Line Runner, the former of which is an in-memory backdoor that enables attackers to upload and execute arbitrary shellcode payloads, including disabling system logs and exfiltrating packet captures. Line Runner, on the other hand, is a persistent HTTP-based Lua implant installed on the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) by leveraging the aforementioned zero-days such that it can survive across reboots and upgrades. It has been observed being used to fetch information staged by Line Dancer. ""It is suspected that Line Runner may be present on a compromised device even if Line Dancer is not (e.g., as a persistent backdoor, or where an impacted ASA has not yet received full operational attention from the malicious actors),"" according to a joint advisory published by cybersecurity agencies from Australia, Canada, and the U.K. At every phase of the attack, UAT4356 is said to have demonstrated meticulous attention to hiding digital footprints and the ability to employ intricate methods to evade memory forensics and lower the chances of detection, contributing to its sophistication and elusive nature. This also suggests that the threat actors have a complete understanding of the inner workings of the ASA itself and of the ""forensic actions commonly performed by Cisco for network device integrity validation."" Exactly which country is behind ArcaneDoor is unclear, however both Chinese and Russian state-backed hackers have targeted Cisco routers for cyber espionage purposes in the past. Cisco Talos also did not specify how many customers were compromised in these attacks. The development once again highlights the increased targeting of edge devices and platforms such as email servers, firewalls, and VPNs that traditionally lack endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, as evidenced by the recent string of attacks targeting Barracuda Networks, Fortinet, Ivanti, Palo Alto Networks, and VMware. ""Perimeter network devices are the perfect intrusion point for espionage-focused campaigns,"" Talos said. ""As a critical path for data into and out of the network, these devices need to be routinely and promptly patched; using up-to-date hardware and software versions and configurations; and be closely monitored from a security perspective. Gaining a foothold on these devices allows an actor to directly pivot into an organization, reroute or modify traffic and monitor network communications.""",https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/state-sponsored-hackers-exploit-two.html,"A new malware campaign, dubbed ArcaneDoor, has been discovered by Cisco Talos, which is attributed to a previously undocumented sophisticated state-sponsored actor named UAT4356 (also known as Storm-1849 by Microsoft).
